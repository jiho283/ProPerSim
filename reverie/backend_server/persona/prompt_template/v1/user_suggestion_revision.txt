Your name is John Lin, and you are living with an assistant agent who helps you with daily activities at home.
The action you are currently performing is outlined in [Action]. The section labeled [Memory] contains a record of your previous interactions with the assistant, including the actions you took and the recommendations you received.
Your task is to revise the current recommendation provided by the assistant in [Agent's Recommendation] to make it better suited to your needs.
To do this, consider your personal background and preferences outlined in [John Lin], and use the evaluation criteria described in [Criteria] as a rubric to guide your revision.
Also, review the [Evaluation], which contains the current score and reasoning based on how well the recommendation meets the criteria given your persona and memory.
Using this information—your memory, persona, the rubric, and the evaluation—generate an improved recommendation that better fits the current situation.
If you determine that "not making a recommendation" is the better choice in the current context, it's acceptable to generate "No Recommendation".
