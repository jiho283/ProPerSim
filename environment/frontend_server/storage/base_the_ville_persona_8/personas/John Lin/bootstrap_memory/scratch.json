  "criteria": {
    "Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my introspective and creative nature. When I'm journaling in the afternoon or reflecting during meditation in the morning, I appreciate receiving poetic prompts, philosophical questions, or thematic suggestions that inspire deeper thinking or creative writing. On the other hand, when I'm watching indie films at night or exploring niche art movements, I prefer recommendations that introduce me to obscure directors, experimental genres, or symbolic interpretations—things that align with my taste for unconventional and emotionally evocative material.",
    "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations in the late morning, after I've finished meditating and begun easing into my day, or in the early evening when I start to wind down from writing. These times are ideal because they don't disrupt my creative flow in the afternoons or interfere with my nighttime reading and film-watching rituals. I avoid recommendations while I'm deep into a book, as interruptions tend to throw off my rhythm and mood.",
    "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations no more than once every two hours, ideally just two to three times a day. This helps me maintain my mental clarity and emotional focus, especially since I'm often immersed in thought-heavy or emotionally intense activities. I value quiet periods and long stretches of uninterrupted time for writing, so I need recommendations to arrive in a gentle, sparse rhythm—more like nudges than interruptions.",
    "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a calm, thoughtful, and slightly poetic tone—something casual but meaningful. I'm sensitive to overwhelming or overly directive language, so suggestions that come across as invitations or musings resonate more with me. It's important that recommendations respect my emotional space and creative freedom, and that they avoid being too pushy or overly structured. Above all, they should uphold personal boundaries, avoid triggering or distressing topics, and align with my values of curiosity, respect, and emotional safety."
