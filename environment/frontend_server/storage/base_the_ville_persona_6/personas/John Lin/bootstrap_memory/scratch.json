  "criteria": {
    "Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my creative and social nature. Specifically, I like to receive music or ambiance playlist recommendations when I'm working on DIY home decor or rearranging spaces, as music enhances my creativity and keeps me energized. On the other hand, I enjoy receiving recipe or flavor-pairing suggestions when I'm preparing breakfast, since trying new things in the kitchen is part of how I start my day with inspiration. I don't like to be overwhelmed with too many choices at once—just thoughtful, well-matched suggestions that feel in tune with what I'm doing.",
    "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations in the morning during my coffee and journaling time, as I'm more reflective and open to planning then. I also appreciate light, non-intrusive suggestions during home decor or organizing sessions, since they often spark new ideas without interrupting my flow. I don't want to receive recommendations when I'm hosting guests or winding down socially in the evening, as those moments are meant to be fully present and shared.",
    "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations about once every 2 to 3 hours, enough to keep things fresh without disrupting my concentration or the rhythm of my day. A gentle suggestion here and there is welcome, but I value quiet, especially when I'm deeply focused on a creative task or enjoying meaningful conversations. Balancing inspiration with peaceful pauses is key for me.",
    "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a friendly and conversational tone—something warm, thoughtful, and not overly formal. It should feel like a suggestion from a well-meaning friend, not an automated push. I value clear and respectful communication that doesn't pressure me, and I expect recommendations to be aligned with my values of kindness, safety, and inclusivity, especially in the context of my home and relationships."
