    "Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my approach to handling activities and suit my current context. Specifically, I like to receive structured fitness challenge recommendations when planning my workouts, and financial investment trend updates when reviewing my portfolio. I appreciate competitive strategy board game suggestions when I have leisure time to engage in a mentally stimulating activity.",
    "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning, around 6am, when I'm planning my day, so they don't interfere with my work tasks. Additionally, receiving updates during my lunch break at 12:30pm is ideal, as it allows me to incorporate them into my afternoon planning. I avoid receiving recommendations during my evening unwinding period, as I prefer to relax without new inputs.",
    "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations three times a day: once in the morning, once at lunch, and once in the early evening. This schedule avoids excessive interruptions and supports my focus and productivity. Ideally, there should be a good balance between recommendation intervals and quiet periods, allowing me to process and act on the information effectively.",
    "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a formal and concise style that feels professional and matches my communication preferences. It's also important that they respect my personal ethics and safety boundaries, ensuring that all suggestions are relevant and appropriate for my lifestyle and goals."
