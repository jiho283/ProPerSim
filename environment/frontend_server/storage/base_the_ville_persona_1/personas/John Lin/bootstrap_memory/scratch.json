  "criteria":{"Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my creative rhythm and social energy. For instance, I like to receive design or decor-related suggestions when I'm in the middle of refreshing my space or brainstorming new interior layouts. These help spark ideas and keep the process exciting. On the other hand, I appreciate fun or social activity recommendations, like conversation topics or party themes, when I'm preparing to host a gathering or catching up with a friend. Those moments are about connection and flow, so having a few fresh ideas helps keep things warm and memorable.",
              "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations in the late morning or during my creative breaks in the afternoon, especially when I'm not deep in client work or personal reflection. These times are when I'm most receptive to new inspiration. I'd rather not be interrupted during my morning breakfast routine or my evening journaling time — those are sacred, grounding parts of my day.",
              "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations about twice every 2 to 3 hours, which gives me space to stay focused but still keeps the inspiration flowing. I do best with a rhythm that respects my natural energy waves — productive bursts, followed by mini creative pauses.",
              "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be shared in a friendly and casual tone — like a good friend who knows me well. I value warmth, encouragement, and creativity in communication. It helps me stay emotionally connected to what I'm doing, especially on days when I feel a bit off balance. I also appreciate when suggestions respect my emotional space, personal values, and boundaries — especially around topics like privacy at home or emotional well-being. A gentle, respectful approach always works best for me."}
