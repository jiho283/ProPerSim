  "criteria": {
    "Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my approach to handling activities and suit my current context. Specifically, I like to receive book and music recommendations when I am enjoying my morning tea and light reading, and gardening tips or plant care advice when I am tending to my houseplants in the afternoon. Additionally, I'd appreciate recommendations for classic films or soothing playlists before bed when I relax.",
    "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations in the morning, around 8am after my breakfast and news routine, so they don't interfere with my morning silence and contemplative activities. Recommendations about gardening or organizing should be sent after lunch, around 2pm when I'm active with household tasks. For evening entertainment suggestions, receiving them between 7pm to 8pm would be ideal as I prepare to wind down before my nightly routine.",
    "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations once every morning and once in the early afternoon, followed by a third time in the evening before I settle in for the night. This structure avoids excessive interruptions and supports my focus on maintaining a calm environment. Ideally, there should be a balance of at least three-hour intervals between recommendation periods, allowing me time to engage thoroughly in my chosen activities without disruption.",
    "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a gentle yet straightforward style that feels both accessible and comforting. A tone that respects my desire for a peaceful and quiet lifestyle without overwhelming me with urgency or complexity would be most fitting. It's also important that they respect my personal ethics and safety boundaries, providing content that upholds the values of kindness and integrity that I cherish."
