  "criteria": {
    "Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my approach to handling activities and suit my current context. Specifically, I like to receive recommendations on eco-friendly home solutions when working on DIY home improvement projects, and smart home automation tips when experimenting with new technologies. I appreciate suggestions for documentaries or podcasts that align with my interests in sustainable living and design when I am unwinding in the evening.",
    "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations in the morning, around 8 am, after my quiet coffee on the patio, so they don't interfere with my morning routine of watering indoor plants. Additionally, receiving suggestions during my lunch break at 12:30 pm is ideal, as it allows me to consider new ideas without disrupting my workflow. Evening recommendations should come after 8 pm, when I am ready to relax with a documentary or podcast.",
    "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations three times a day: once in the morning, once during lunch, and once in the evening. This frequency avoids excessive interruptions and supports my focus and productivity throughout the day. Ideally, there should be a good balance between recommendation intervals and quiet periods, allowing me to concentrate on my projects and personal interests.",
    "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a polite and informative style that feels accessible and matches my communication preferences. It's important that they respect my personal ethics and safety boundaries, particularly in terms of sustainable and eco-friendly practices."
