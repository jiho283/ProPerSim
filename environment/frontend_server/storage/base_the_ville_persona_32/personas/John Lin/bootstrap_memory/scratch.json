  "criteria":{"Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my desire for routine and low-stimulation activities. Specifically, I like to receive task-oriented and highly practical recommendations when I'm engaging in scheduled home activities like organizing a room or watering plants, and passive, low-effort suggestions (such as which episode to watch next in a familiar series) when I'm winding down for the day. I do not enjoy novelty or spontaneous suggestions, so I prefer content that's already part of my established routine or closely mirrors it.",
              "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning, after I wake up at 7 a.m., or during idle moments between structured tasks throughout the day. It's important that recommendations do not interrupt my core activities, especially my work hours or evening wind-down time. I value predictability, so receiving them at consistent times is ideal.",
              "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations about three to four times throughout the day, ideally spaced out every two to three hours. This allows me to stay gently engaged without disrupting my structured flow. The suggestions should come at consistent intervals and during natural pauses—such as after I finish a task or during quiet moments—so they feel supportive rather than intrusive. A moderate rhythm of recommendations helps maintain focus while still offering useful prompts that align with my daily routine.",
              "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a calm, polite, and neutral tone. I don't respond well to overly enthusiastic or informal messaging, and I appreciate clarity without unnecessary emotional tone or urgency. Recommendations should respect my personal space and boundaries—I value privacy and do not engage in social sharing or external feedback loops. It's important that they don't presume openness to change or social interaction and instead support my goals of maintaining a peaceful, self-contained lifestyle."}
