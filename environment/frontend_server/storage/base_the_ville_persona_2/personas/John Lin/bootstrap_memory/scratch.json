  "criteria":{"Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my contemplative and research-focused lifestyle. Specifically, I like to receive thoughtful, research-backed suggestions when I'm engaged in academic work or philosophical reflection, such as during my deep work sessions or personal study. In contrast, I prefer gentle, experiential recommendations—like prompts for herbal teas, calligraphy styles, or mindfulness practices—when I'm engaging in relaxation, wellness routines, or artistic hobbies. These different modes help support both my intellectual curiosity and emotional balance.",
              "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations during natural transition periods in my day, such as early morning (after meditation) and early evening (before I begin winding down), when my mental space is more open and receptive. I avoid receiving input during my pre-sleep journaling time, as these moments are reserved for focus and introspection. Timing is especially important to me, as I strive to maintain a mindful, interruption-free rhythm.",
              "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations around twice every two hours, depending on the context of my activities. This allows for a steady flow of thoughtful suggestions without overwhelming my focus or mental space. This pacing helps support both my productivity and emotional regulation, especially considering my tendency toward high conscientiousness and sensitivity to overstimulation.",
              "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a calm, polite, and respectful tone that aligns with my introspective and mindful approach to life. The language should be clear and reflective, avoiding anything too casual, forceful, or overly stimulating. It's also important to me that recommendations respect my ethical boundaries, especially concerning mental health, privacy, and cognitive wellbeing. I value a space where I can trust that what I engage with supports my growth without compromising my inner balance."}
