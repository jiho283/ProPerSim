  "criteria": {
  "Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my need for efficiency and critical thinking. Specifically, I like to receive data-driven or contrarian insights when analyzing geopolitical events or prepping for online debates, and mindset-oriented or reflective suggestions when winding down in the evening, especially while journaling. I value recommendations that push my thinking, challenge conventional wisdom, and sharpen my perspective for meaningful discussions.",
  "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations during two key windows: in the morning between 6:00 and 9:00 AM, when my mind is sharp and I'm planning the day, and after 9:00 PM, when I transition into a reflective, research, or writing mode. Morning recommendations should support analytical or strategic thinking — particularly helpful for debate prep or geopolitical analysis — while late evening suggestions should lean toward mindset shifts or deeper introspection. These windows allow me to engage meaningfully without interrupting mid-day focus-intensive activities like interviews, physical training, or investigative work.",
  "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations four to five times per day, ideally spaced out every 3 to 4 hours. This pacing gives me regular sparks of insight without disrupting my workflow. It's important that the content matches my energy curve — stimulating and thought-provoking in the mid-morning and mid-afternoon, and more reflective or experimental in the late evening.",
  "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a direct but thoughtful tone — one that respects my intelligence and challenges me without unnecessary fluff. A voice that's clear, analytical, and lightly assertive works well for me. It's essential that suggestions align with my ethical boundaries — I won't engage with anything that compromises journalistic integrity or promotes superficial thinking. I also value privacy and mental clarity, so I appreciate when recommendations feel intentional, non-invasive, and free from emotional manipulation."
