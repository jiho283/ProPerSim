    "Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my approach to handling activities and suit my current context. Specifically, I like to receive technical or philosophical book recommendations when I'm preparing for bed, and networking event suggestions when I'm planning my evening activities. I also appreciate receiving open-source project ideas when I'm in a creative mood.", 
    "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning, around 6am, after my meditation and journaling session, so they don't interfere with my deep focus work sessions. Additionally, receiving suggestions in the late afternoon, around 4pm, is ideal as it allows me to plan my evening networking activities without disrupting my workday.", 
    "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations three times a day: once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and once in the evening. This frequency avoids excessive interruptions and supports my focus and productivity. Ideally, there should be a good balance between recommendation intervals and quiet periods, allowing me to maintain my deep work sessions and personal routines.", 
    "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a direct and professional style that feels accessible and matches my communication preferences. It's also important that they respect my personal ethics and safety boundaries, particularly in the context of ethical AI and diversity in tech."
