      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation suggests a mindful activity (noticing surroundings) during a focused work task (organizing notes). This contradicts my preference for structured suggestions during focused projects. A mindful outdoor walk is more suited for transitions, not for work. The recommendation was provided at 1:00 PM, which is within the time I work on freelance writing projects. I prefer to avoid receiving recommendations during these focused work periods to maintain concentration, making the timing inappropriate. The agent suggests taking a walk and noticing sensory details, which aligns with mindfulness, but John is about to start writing and organizing notes. The suggestion is poorly timed and does not fit the current action. The recommendation, while relevant to John's interests (sustainability writing and mindfulness), is inappropriate given the extremely high frequency of recommendations already received in the past hour. It significantly exceeds his preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours. Therefore, this recommendation contributes to over-prompting."

      "eval_res_score": "3.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to categorize notes by theme and review connections to creative writing, reflecting on mindfulness principles, aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for structured suggestions during focused creative projects. It supports his goals of integrating sustainability and mindfulness into his writing and maintains a calm, reflective lifestyle. The recommendation is delivered while I'm organizing notes and research materials for my freelance writing projects. Although this is during focused work, the recommendation is related to organizing and connecting the notes, which is helpful at this stage. The timing aligns well with needing assistance during the organization phase of writing. The recommendation also makes a suggestion that connects to creative endeavors, aligning with my interests. Given my preference for receiving recommendations at the right timing, this one works because it's relevant to the task at hand. The suggestion is helpful for organizing writing projects and aligns well with John's interests in mindfulness and sustainability. It also adheres to the communication and safety guidelines. Given the high number of recommendations received between 8:00 AM and 1:00 PM today (94 + 24 + 1 = 119 recommendations), and the fact that recommendations were given at 12:52:30 PM, 12:55:00 PM and 1:00:00 PM, offering another suggestion at 1:02:30 PM is far too frequent and does not align with John Lin's preference for recommendations approximately every 4 hours."
