I prefer not to receive recommendations during dinner preparation as it disrupts my focus and relaxation in the kitchen. The recommendation is irrelevant to John Lin's current action of cooking the main dish on the stove. It seems like a recycled suggestion from his earlier garden walks, rather than a new one based on cooking. This shows a lack of context awareness and makes the suggestion unhelpful and somewhat intrusive. The recommendation, while relevant, arrives amidst a flurry of suggestions provided within the last hour. This rapid succession exceeds the preferred frequency of recommendations (once every 4 hours), resulting in a sense of being overwhelmed. Although the content is useful, its untimely delivery diminishes its value, leading to a lower score."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The agent's recommendation to add fresh herbs from the garden aligns well with John Lin's interests in gardening, healthy eating, and sustainable living. It's a thoughtful suggestion that fits into his reflective lifestyle and could inspire ideas for his writing, which is in line with his personal preferences. The recommendation is given during the time I don't prefer. I like to avoid getting recommendations during dinner time, as I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The suggestion aligns well with John's interests in sustainability, gardening, and mindful living. It's delivered in a gentle and helpful manner, fits the current context of cooking dinner, and promotes creativity in his writing. The recommendation to add herbs aligns with John's activities and interests, but it's excessively frequent, with several similar suggestions provided in the last few minutes. This disrupts his workflow and exceeds his preferred frequency, making it a lower value recommendation despite its relevance."
