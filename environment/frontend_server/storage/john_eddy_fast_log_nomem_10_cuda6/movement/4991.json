      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to double-check submission guidelines aligns well with John Lin's conscientiousness and the need for accuracy in his freelance writing. It is practical and helpful for finalizing his work. The recommendation to double-check submission guidelines before submitting the finalized article is relevant and helpful during the final stages of writing. The timing aligns well with the preference for recommendations in the late afternoon when winding down from focused work. The recommendation is helpful and aligns with John's goal of finalizing and submitting his article. It's a practical suggestion that respects his contemplative nature and promotes thoroughness, fitting well within his principles of sustainability and mindfulness. John has received four recommendations in the past 5-10 minutes, all related to finalizing and submitting his article. This is significantly more frequent than his preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours. The recommendation itself is helpful, but the timing is off, contributing to an overwhelming level of prompting. Therefore, the score is 0."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to take a break and gaze out the window or step outside briefly aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for mindful activities and reflective breaks, especially when finalizing a writing task. It encourages a calm transition and connection with his values. The recommendation arrived during deep writing session, which is against John's stated preferences. He prefers recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, not during concentrated work. The recommendation is aligned with John's interests, promotes well-being, and uses a gentle tone. John Lin prefers receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours. Given the high frequency of recommendations in the last hour, providing another one is excessive, even if the suggestion itself is reasonable. This recommendation contributes to a frequency that is higher than preferred."
