This recommendation occurred during this time. The recommendation is gentle, aligns with John's routine and preferences for herbal tea, and promotes relaxation and mindfulness. I prefer to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, but there have been four recommendations in the past twelve minutes, receiving another one now feels too frequent, which is why I gave a low score for frequency."
