      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preferences. It suggests a short break in the garden, which fits his love for nature, mindfulness, and reflective practices, especially during creative writing. It also echoes previous productive sessions, making it a relevant and thoughtful suggestion. I prefer to avoid getting recommendations during deep writing sessions, and the timing is 11:57:30 AM when I'm working on my writing project. Therefore, I gave it a low rating. The recommendation aligns with John's interests and principles, suggesting a break in the garden, which has proven to be a source of inspiration for his writing. The tone is gentle and respectful, fitting John's preference for friendly suggestions. John Lin prefers receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours. Given that he has already received 24 recommendations between 10:00 AM and 11:57:30 AM and has been recommended to take breaks several times, this recommendation is too frequent."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation is well-aligned with John Lin's preference for mindful activities during transitions. Suggesting he breathe in fresh air and notice inspiring sights/sounds as he transitions to lunch from his writing project fits his calm, reflective lifestyle and aligns with his interest in nature and mindfulness. I prefer not to receive recommendations during my lunch break, as I use this time to recharge and prefer minimal distractions. The timing is therefore inappropriate. The recommendation aligns with John's interests in creative writing, sustainability, and mindfulness. It suggests a short break to find inspiration in nature, which fits his contemplative nature and promotes emotional wellbeing. The recommendation is relevant to John's interests and past activities, but it's arriving immediately after a series of similar recommendations within a very short time frame (past 10 minutes), far exceeding the preferred frequency of once every 4 hours or a maximum of three times a day. Therefore, a score of 0 is appropriate."
