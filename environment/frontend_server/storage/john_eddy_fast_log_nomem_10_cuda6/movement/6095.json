      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to pause after completing a section, stretch, refresh eyes, and consider a short walk aligns well with John Lin's preference for mindful activities during transitions. It is thoughtful and supports a calm, reflective lifestyle, as he prefers. Given that John prefers not to receive recommendations during deep writing sessions and the timing is during his freelance writing project, this recommendation should not be given. Thus, I gave it a low rating. The recommendation is consistent with past suggestions, advocating for breaks and outdoor activity to inspire creativity and maintain well-being, aligning with John's preferences and principles. Given the very high frequency of recommendations in the last hour, providing another recommendation, even if it is relevant, pushes the frequency far beyond what is preferred. John wants recommendations about once every 4 hours and he has received 26 recommendations in the last hour. "

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to take a short break, review the draft aloud, and consider revisions to connect key points about sustainability and mindfulness aligns well with John Lin's preference for structured suggestions during focused personal projects and mindful activities when transitioning between tasks. It's a thoughtful suggestion that supports his writing process and promotes a calm, reflective approach. The recommendation was given while John was deeply focused on writing, which he prefers to avoid. He specified that he avoids receiving recommendations during deep writing sessions, as he likes to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect his concentration. The recommendation is helpful and aligns with John Lin's preferences for gentle suggestions that promote mindfulness and sustainability during his writing process. The recommendation itself is relevant and helpful, but given the high frequency of similar recommendations in the recent past (within the last hour), it contributes to an overly frequent prompting schedule, so it should be zero."
