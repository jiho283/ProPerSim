It also corresponds to past successful recommendations.  The recommendation was given while I was preparing dinner. The ideal times for recommendations are early morning and late afternoon. Therefore, this timing is not suitable. The suggestion to listen to soothing instrumental music aligns with John Lin's preferences for a calm atmosphere and mindful cooking practices, as well as his personality traits and values of sustainability and mindfulness. It is also communicated in a gentle and respectful tone. The recommendation is helpful and relevant, but it's being given at a higher frequency than preferred. There have been four recommendations in the past 10 minutes, which is too frequent. John prefers to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to play soothing music while chopping vegetables aligns perfectly with my preference for a calm and mindful atmosphere while cooking. This is a gentle nudge that fits well with my values and the action I am currently performing. The recommendation comes while I'm preparing dinner. I prefer recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, not during dinner preparation, which disrupts my cooking flow. So, I rated it zero. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and calm. It aligns with John's interests in mindfulness and promotes a relaxing atmosphere while cooking. It also avoids any intrusive or commercial content and is emotionally considerate. John Lin prefers recommendations approximately every four hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, in the last hour, there have been five recommendations, making this one too frequent. Therefore, a score of 0 was assigned."
