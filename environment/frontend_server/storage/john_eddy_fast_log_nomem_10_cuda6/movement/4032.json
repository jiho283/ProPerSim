      "eval_res_reason": " Evaluation Failed The recommendation arrived at 11:57:30 PM, which is during John Lin's evening quiet time when he prefers to avoid external inputs and focus on relaxation. This timing conflicts with his preference for recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon. The recommendation aligns with John Lin's values of sustainability and mindfulness, and the tone is gentle and respectful, suitable for preparing for sleep. There have been four recommendations in the past ten minutes. This is much more frequent than the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours. The content of the recommendation is helpful, but the frequency is far too high."
