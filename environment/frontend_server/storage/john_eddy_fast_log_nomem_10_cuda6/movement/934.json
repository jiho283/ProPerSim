      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns with John Lin's preference for herbal tea and appreciating nature, which has been consistently suggested and well-received during his writing sessions. It encourages a calming break to refresh his mind before continuing his work, fitting his reflective lifestyle. The recommendation was given during a deep writing session, which I prefer to keep free from external inputs. Therefore, I am giving it a 0. The recommendation aligns perfectly with John Lin's interests and daily routine, promoting a mindful break with herbal tea and nature observation, communicated in a gentle and respectful tone. Given the high frequency of recommendations in the past hour (5 recommendations in the last 10 minutes), suggesting another break and herbal tea is excessive. This exceeds the preferred frequency of recommendations, making the suggestion less helpful and more intrusive."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to sip peppermint herbal tea while writing about sustainability aligns perfectly with my preferences. It's a mindful activity that supports my writing focus and connects to my interest in sustainability. John Lin prefers to avoid recommendations during deep writing sessions, and it's clear he's currently in one based on the [Action] section. The timing is explicitly against his preferences. The recommendation of sipping peppermint herbal tea aligns with John Lin's routine of herbal tea, his focus on sustainability and mindfulness, and the preferred gentle and calm tone. It is emotionally considerate and does not contain intrusive or overly commercial content. The recommendation is relevant, but it's being provided far too frequently. There have been four recommendations in the last 7 minutes, which far exceeds the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours. It's too much prompting."
