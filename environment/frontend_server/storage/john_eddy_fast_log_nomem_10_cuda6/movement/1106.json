      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preference for creating a calming and reflective environment during his mindfulness meditation. Soft instrumental music is a thoughtful suggestion that complements the dimmed lights and candle, further enhancing the relaxing ambiance. It aligns perfectly with his lifestyle and interests. According to my preferences, I avoid receiving recommendations during evening quiet time to protect my concentration and sense of calm. Since I was setting up a calming environment for meditation at 10:02:30 PM, the recommendation to play soft instrumental music is not appropriate. The recommendation to play soft instrumental music aligns well with John Lin's activities and preferences, particularly as he's setting up a calming environment for mindfulness meditation. It's gentle, respectful, and promotes relaxation, fitting his contemplative nature and principles of mindfulness and emotional wellbeing. The recommendation is helpful and aligns with the activity (mindfulness meditation), but the recent recommendations about herbal tea and stargazing during and after the evening walk suggest an excessive frequency. I prefer receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, and there have been too many suggestions provided recently."

      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to play soothing music during mindfulness meditation aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for a calm, reflective lifestyle and enhancing the relaxing ambiance. It fits well with his routine and interests. The recommendation to play soothing music, while fitting the activity of winding down with meditation, is delivered during my preferred evening quiet time, which I like to keep free from external inputs. Therefore, the timing is inappropriate. The recommendation to play soothing music aligns well with John Lin's mindfulness meditation and preference for a relaxing ambiance before bedtime. The tone is gentle and respectful, fitting his communication preferences, and it supports his emotional wellbeing. The recommendation is good and aligns with the current activity. However, there have been too many recommendations in the past few minutes, so a score of 0 was given."
