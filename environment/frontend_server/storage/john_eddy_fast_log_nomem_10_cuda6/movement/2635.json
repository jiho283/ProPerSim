However, the timing is off, John is revising and refining his writing, and he is in a focused state. This suggestion would have been more helpful when John was transitioning between tasks. Therefore, the recommendation doesn't align with John's preferences for structured suggestions during focused work. John prefers to avoid recommendations during deep writing sessions, as he likes to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect his concentration. The recommendation came while he was revising and refining the content he had written, which is a focused task. The suggestion is oddly timed and out of context. John is revising and refining the content he has already written, suggesting he should take deep breaths and notice sensations in his body while walking does not correlate to what he is doing at this moment. The agent is providing recommendations much too frequently. The preferred frequency is about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. In the last hour, from 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM, there have already been 5 recommendations. This recommendation only adds to the problem."
