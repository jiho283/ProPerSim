      "eval_res_score": "3.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to set an alarm for a power nap and prepare herbal tea upon waking aligns well with John Lin's preference for a calm and reflective lifestyle, as well as his existing routines involving herbal tea and mindfulness. The suggestion supports his daily plan requirement of practicing meditation and unwinding, promoting relaxation and preparing him for the afternoon. The recommendation to set an alarm for the nap is very practical, and since it is during napping, it does not clash with any of John Lin's preferences, so I gave it a high rating. The suggestion to set an alarm and prepare tea is practical for a power nap, aligns with John Lin's preferences for a soothing experience, and is communicated in a gentle tone. The recommendation to set an alarm and prepare herbal tea is helpful, but considering the previous four recommendations within a 10-minute window, providing another recommendation now results in a frequency that is too high. Therefore, the score is 0."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to set an alarm for 20 minutes aligns with John's need to wake up refreshed. Suggesting herbal tea upon waking also fits his preference for herbal tea and a calm, reflective lifestyle. It is a practical and mindful suggestion. John Lin is currently trying to fall asleep, and this is neither early morning or late afternoon which are his preferred times for recommendations. He likely wants to avoid interruptions at this point. The recommendation is consistent with John's routine and preferences. It's gentle, respectful, and promotes well-being by suggesting a nap duration and herbal tea upon waking. This suggestion aligns with his need for sustainable and mindful living, is emotionally considerate, and enhances his current activity. John is trying to fall asleep and has received 4 recommendations in the last 10 minutes while preparing for and starting his nap. Recommending setting an alarm and preparing tea upon waking is helpful, but the frequency is too high. Therefore, the score is zero."
