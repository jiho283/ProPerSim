I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon, but I am working and getting recommendations during deep writing sessions. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, aligns with John's interests, and promotes a focused mindset suitable for his writing project. It also avoids any intrusive or urgent tones, fitting his preference for a calm and contemplative approach. The recommendation to play soft instrumental music to enhance focus is relevant to John's current task. However, based on the memory, he has received numerous recommendations in the past hour regarding outlining his writing project. This frequency far exceeds his preference of receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, making the current recommendation excessive."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " This recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preferences. Given that he's outlining a writing project on sustainability and mindfulness, suggesting a short stroll or stretches with natural sunlight is a thoughtful way to refresh his mindset and clarify his thoughts. It fits his calm, reflective lifestyle and his appreciation for mindful activities, especially when transitioning within tasks. The recommendation was provided during a deep writing session, which I prefer to avoid to maintain concentration. Although the content of the recommendation is helpful, the timing is not suitable. The suggestion to refresh his mindset with a walk or stretches aligns with John's mindfulness and sustainability principles. It's presented in a gentle, non-intrusive manner, respecting his contemplative nature and promoting emotional well-being. It also follows previous suggestions in the memory log to take breaks and engage with nature. There have been multiple recommendations within the last 10 minutes while John is trying to outline his writing project. This exceeds the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours, so the score should be zero."
