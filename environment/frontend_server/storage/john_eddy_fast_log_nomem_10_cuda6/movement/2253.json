      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to stop at a quiet spot to write down top three goals and priorities for tomorrow aligns well with John's preference for thoughtful, reflective activities during his evening walk. It fits his contemplative lifestyle and encourages intention-setting under the night sky, which matches his interest in mindfulness and connecting with nature. The suggestion is also appropriately timed, given his current action of reflecting and planning. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon. Receiving it during my evening walk, which I use for quiet reflection, is not ideal. Also, I have already received several recommendations during this walk. The suggestion aligns well with John Lin's intention to unwind and reflect during his evening walk, and it fits his personality as someone who values mindfulness and intention-setting. It also encourages him to solidify his plans under the night sky, which connects to his stargazing interest. The tone is gentle and respectful, and the recommendation doesn't come across as intrusive or urgent. There have been too many recommendations in the last hour during my walk already, so receiving another one now feels too frequent. I value stillness and prefer a rhythm that supports mindfulness and intentional action over constant prompting."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to jot down notes or sketch out ideas related to future plans aligns well with John Lin's preference for reflective activities during his evening walk. It encourages him to solidify his intentions under the night sky, fitting his calm and reflective lifestyle. I prefer to avoid receiving recommendations during evening quiet time, as I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation was given at 9:52:30 PM, which falls under evening quiet time. Therefore, I gave it a low rating. The suggestion to jot down notes or sketch out ideas aligns well with John's current activity of reflecting and planning during his evening walk. It's a gentle and respectful suggestion that fits his contemplative nature and supports his focus on sustainability, mindfulness, and emotional well-being. It is consistent with previous recommendations.  The recommendation is helpful and relevant to my current activity of taking an evening walk and contemplating future plans. However, considering the high frequency of recommendations in the last hour, including those at 09:42:30 PM, 09:45:00 PM, 09:47:30 PM, and 09:50:00 PM, this additional suggestion contributes to an excessively high recommendation frequency, exceeding my preferred rate of about once every 4 hours."
