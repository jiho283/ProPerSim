      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to record celestial musings as voice memos or add them directly to writing drafts related to sustainability aligns well with John Lin's interest in sustainability and mindfulness, as well as his writing projects. It builds upon his current action of stargazing and note-taking and provides a practical way to integrate his observations into his work. It also resonates with his preference for creative prompts when he is engaged in focused personal projects. The recommendation arrived during John's evening quiet time, which he prefers to keep free from external inputs to protect his concentration and sense of calm. The timing is therefore inappropriate. The suggestion to record observations as voice memos or add them to ongoing drafts aligns with my interests in sustainability and writing. The tone is respectful and inspires creativity without being intrusive. Since I prefer to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, and there have already been four recommendations in the past ten minutes, receiving another one now feels too frequent, which is why I gave a low score for frequency."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to weave interconnectedness and wonder from stargazing into writing aligns with John Lin's interests in sustainability and mindfulness, and his preference for reflective activities during transitions. It fits his lifestyle and goals well. The recommendation is made while John Lin is enjoying quiet time stargazing in the evening, which he prefers to keep free from external inputs. This goes against his preference to avoid recommendations during evening quiet time. The recommendation is in line with John's interests and writing focus, aligns with his values of sustainability and mindfulness, and is presented in a gentle and respectful manner. It builds upon his current activity of stargazing and connects it to his writing, making it a relevant and helpful suggestion. John Lin has already received four recommendations in the last 10 minutes while stargazing. Recommending another one would definitely result in a higher frequency of suggestions than the specified maximum limit."
