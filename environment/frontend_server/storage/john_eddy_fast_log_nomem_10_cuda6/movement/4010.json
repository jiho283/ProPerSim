      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to play soothing music while tidying up aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for a calm and reflective environment, especially when transitioning to bedtime. This fosters relaxation and enhances the overall peaceful ambiance he seeks. The recommendation was provided while I was preparing for bed, which is considered evening quiet time according to my preferences. I prefer to avoid recommendations during this time. The recommendation is aligned with John Lin's preference for a peaceful and relaxing environment. Suggesting soothing music while tidying up is gentle, respectful, and promotes relaxation, aligning with his mindfulness principles. John has received many recommendations in the last few hours, especially related to his meditation and evening routine. Recommending more background music now feels like overkill and goes against the need for stillness and intentional action that John values. The frequency is too high."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to use scented candles or essential oils aligns well with John Lin's preference for a calm and reflective lifestyle and complements the activity of tidying up before bed. It promotes relaxation and enhances the tranquil ambiance, fitting his established evening routine. I don't want to receive recommendations during evening quiet time as I like to keep that space free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The suggestion aligns with John Lin's preference for creating a tranquil atmosphere and promotes relaxation while preparing for bed, fitting his interests in mindfulness and emotional well-being. The suggestion is respectful, gentle, and considerate, avoiding any urgency or intrusive content. John has already received several recommendations very recently, and is now preparing for bed, so lighting candles at 11:05 PM is not a good idea. Thus the recommendation is not useful and the frequency of recommendations is excessive."
