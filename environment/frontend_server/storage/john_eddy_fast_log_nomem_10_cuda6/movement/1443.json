      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The agent suggests listening to soothing music while cooking, which aligns well with John Lin's preference for a calm and reflective lifestyle and his use of music during morning meditation and creative projects. The recommendation is thoughtful and enhances relaxation during lunch preparation. I prefer receiving recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon. Receiving one while preparing lunch is outside my preferred timing, so I rated it low. The recommendation is consistent with past successful suggestions, aligns with John Lin's preferences for relaxation and mindfulness, and is delivered in a gentle tone. It's safe, ethical, and considerate of his contemplative nature. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. Given the high frequency of recommendations between 8:00 AM and 12:02:30 PM, and considering that another recommendation was given at 12:02:30 PM, providing yet another one at 12:05:00 PM is far too frequent."

      "eval_res_score": "3.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preferences. It encourages a mindful pause and the consumption of a soothing drink, mirroring his enjoyment of herbal tea and calm moments during other activities. This fits his calm, reflective lifestyle and integrates well with the current activity of preparing lunch. I usually enjoy getting recommendations in the early morning and afternoon. Although it's lunchtime, it's a good time to breathe deeply and drink herbal tea, so I gave it a high rating. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and calm. Suggesting a deep breath and a drink aligns with mindfulness and well-being, fitting John's preferences. It's emotionally considerate and avoids intrusion. There have already been three recommendations in the past 7 minutes while John Lin is preparing lunch. Providing another recommendation is too frequent, given his preference of receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours."
