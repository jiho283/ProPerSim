      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to use herbs from the garden aligns with John Lin's interest in sustainability and mindfulness, and connects well with the documentary suggestion and tea-drinking activity. It encourages a mindful, reflective activity that resonates with his personal preferences. The recommendation comes during John's evening quiet time, a period he prefers to keep free from external inputs. Although the suggestion itself aligns with his interests in sustainability and mindfulness, the timing is inappropriate. The recommendation is gentle, aligned with John Lin's interests in gardening, mindfulness, and writing, and offers a thoughtful suggestion that enhances the experience without being intrusive or demanding. There have been four recommendations in the past 13 minutes, significantly exceeding the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours. Even though the content of the recommendation is relevant and potentially helpful, the high frequency warrants a score of 0."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preference for connecting daily activities with his values of sustainability and mindfulness. Using organic lemon from his own garden enhances the tea-drinking experience and connects it to his gardening efforts, promoting a calm and reflective lifestyle. I prefer to avoid recommendations during evening quiet time, as I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation is gentle, aligned with John's interests in sustainability (organic citrus), gardening, and mindfulness (relaxation). It's also not intrusive and offers a thoughtful way to connect various aspects of his life. The tone is appropriate and non-demanding. I prefer to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. There have already been four recommendations in the past ten minutes, so receiving another one now feels too frequent, which is why I gave a low score for frequency."
