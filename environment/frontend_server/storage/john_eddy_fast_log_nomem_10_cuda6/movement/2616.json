      "eval_res_score": "3.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns perfectly with John's preference for thoughtful, mindful activities when transitioning between tasks. It suggests reviewing morning journals and garden notes to find connections between nature and personal growth before starting the writing session, which fosters creative expression. This fits well with his reflective lifestyle and the desire for gentle nudges during transitions. The recommendation is delivered while John is planning his afternoon writing session during lunchtime. Although this is not the early morning or late afternoon as preferred, it aligns with John's activities of reflecting and preparing for writing, making it relevant and well-timed, earning it a positive rating. The recommendation is aligned with John's interests (nature, personal growth, writing), lifestyle (journaling, gardening), and long-term goals (sustainability, mindfulness). The tone is gentle and respectful. It also logically follows the previous suggestions. The recommendation is helpful and aligns with John's activities, but the frequency of recommendations is too high. Multiple suggestions have been provided within the last few minutes, exceeding the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours."

      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation suggests taking notice of sights and smells while walking, but John is reviewing notes and research materials for his writing projects. This recommendation doesn't align with the current action of focused writing preparation and feels out of context. John is working on his freelance writing projects focused on sustainability and mindfulness, which is a deep writing session. He prefers to avoid recommendations during deep writing sessions, so I gave it a low rating. John is starting his writing session inside, therefore, it's not suitable to recommend him to go for a walk at this moment. The recommendation is provided within an hour of the last recommendation, so it is given more frequently than my preferred frequency. "
