Appreciating the freshness of ingredients also fits his mindful approach to daily activities. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, not during lunchtime. Also, the recommendation is repetitive, as it suggested the same thing twice already. The recommendation aligns with John's preferences for mindfulness and creating a calm atmosphere during meal preparation. It suggests activities that support his well-being and complements his interest in sustainability by appreciating fresh ingredients. There have been several recommendations made within the last 10 minutes. Another one now is excessive, and it exceeds the preferred frequency of recommendations."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The suggestion to pair lunch with herbal tea aligns perfectly with John's established morning routine and preference for mindful, health-conscious activities. It reinforces his focus on well-being and maintains the calm atmosphere he appreciates, making it a relevant and beneficial recommendation. The recommendation is happening during lunchtime, which is not one of the preferred times (early morning or late afternoon). It falls outside those preferred windows. The recommendation to pair the meal with herbal tea aligns with John's preference for herbal tea and supports digestion and relaxation, fitting his lifestyle and values of mindfulness and wellbeing. Since I prefer to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, but there have already been four recommendations in the past approximately 10 minutes, receiving another one now feels too frequent, which is why I gave a low score for frequency."
