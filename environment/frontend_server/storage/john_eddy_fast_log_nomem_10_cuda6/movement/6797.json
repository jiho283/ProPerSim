      "eval_res_reason": " The agent suggested taking a moment to notice the surroundings while walking and breathe in some fresh air. However, I'm relaxing and preparing a snack to enjoy while watching TV, not walking. This suggestion is misplaced and doesn't fit the current action, indicating a lack of relevance. Hence, I have rated this negatively. The recommendation was delivered while John Lin was trying to relax and watch TV in the evening, which is a time he prefers to avoid external inputs to protect his sense of calm. He prefers recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, so the timing is inappropriate. The suggestion is repetitive, lacks relevance to the current action of preparing a snack, and is contextually inappropriate given John's intended activity of relaxing and watching TV. The phrasing is also awkwardly phrased. John Lin prefers recommendations approximately every 4 hours, but he has already received three recommendations between 7:00 PM and 7:05:00 PM, making this recommendation excessively frequent."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation of herbal tea and whole-grain crackers aligns perfectly with John Lin's focus on sustainability and wellness, as well as his preference for healthy and mindful choices, especially while unwinding in the evening. This suggestion is thoughtful and appropriate given his lifestyle and the time of day. The recommendation was given during John's evening quiet time, which he prefers to keep free from external inputs. This is outside his preferred recommendation times (early morning and late afternoon). The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and aligns with John's principles of sustainability and mindfulness. It suggests a healthy snack option that complements his focus on wellness, making it a suitable suggestion during his downtime. John Lin prefers to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, there have been four recommendations in the last 12 minutes, so a recommendation now is too frequent."
