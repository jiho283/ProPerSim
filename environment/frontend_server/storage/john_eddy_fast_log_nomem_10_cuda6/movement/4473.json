      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation is aligned with John Lin's focus on sustainability and connecting with nature, which he appreciates, especially during meal preparation. Moreover, using fresh herbs from the garden elevates the flavor and aroma of the dish, enhancing the overall dining experience and aligning well with John's preference for calm, reflective activities. The recommendation is being delivered during dinner preparation, which isn't during my preferred times of early morning or late afternoon. I also have received similar recommendations continuously. Therefore, I rated it low. The agent's suggestion to add fresh herbs aligns with John Lin's interests in sustainability and connecting with nature, and the recommendation is communicated in a gentle and respectful tone, consistent with his preferences. The recommendation is good in content, but given that John Lin has received numerous suggestions in a short period while preparing dinner, this recommendation contributes to an excessively high frequency, so a score of 0 was given."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to listen to calm instrumental music or nature sounds while preparing dinner aligns perfectly with my preference for a calm, reflective lifestyle and enjoying the process of cooking. It also connects well with the previous suggestions about incorporating elements from my garden into the meal, creating a cohesive and mindful experience. The recommendation was given during the evening while I was preparing dinner, which isn't one of the preferred times for receiving recommendations. I prefer them in the early morning or late afternoon, so the timing is inappropriate. The recommendation to listen to calm music aligns with John's interests in mindfulness and sustainability, and the suggestion is delivered in a gentle tone, promoting emotional wellbeing and a connection with the ingredients. There have been four recommendations within the last 13 minutes, and John prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours. The current recommendation contributes to a frequency that is higher than the preferred frequency, so the score is zero."
