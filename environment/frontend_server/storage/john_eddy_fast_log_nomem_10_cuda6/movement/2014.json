However, given my preference to avoid recommendations during deep writing sessions to protect my concentration, and the fact that I am currently editing and refining a draft, the timing is not ideal. Evaluation Failed There have been many recommendations in the past hour, far exceeding the preferred frequency. Therefore, even if the content of this recommendation aligns with John's current activity, providing yet another suggestion is not helpful."

      "eval_res_reason": " Evaluation Failed The recommendation to take a break for stretching, deep breaths, and tea is reasonable in content, but it's being delivered during a deep writing session, which I specified as a time to avoid external inputs. The timing is therefore unsuitable. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and aligns with John Lin's preferences for mindfulness, sustainability, and emotional well-being. Suggesting a break for stretching, deep breaths, and herbal tea fits his lifestyle and preferences. I prefer receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. In the last 1 hour and 55 minutes, the agent has already provided 24 recommendations, which far exceeds my preferred frequency. Although the recommendation to take a short break to stretch and practice deep breaths is relevant to my activity, the frequency is too high."
