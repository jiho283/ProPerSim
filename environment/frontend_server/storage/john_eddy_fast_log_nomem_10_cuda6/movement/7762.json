I'm in the middle of outlining, which is a deep writing session. I don't want recommendations during this time to protect my concentration. The timing is bad. The recommendation aligns with John's interests in mindfulness and sustainability, building on his morning routine. The tone is gentle and respectful, fitting his preferences. Given the recent history of frequent recommendations regarding his writing piece, and the fact that it is only 2.5 minutes after the last recommendation, this suggestion is far too frequent, leading to a score of 0."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The agent's recommendation to take a short break to brew herbal tea and mindfully sip it while reviewing the outline aligns perfectly with John's preference for mindful activities during transitions. It is thoughtful, reflective, and supports his calm lifestyle while working on his sustainability writing. I don't want to receive recommendations during deep writing sessions, which is what I'm currently doing, focusing on outlining the main points of my piece. The recommendation to take a break and brew herbal tea, while relevant to my interests, interrupts my concentration. The recommendation aligns with John Lin's interests, daily plans, and communication preferences. It's gentle, promotes mindfulness, and fits with his focus on sustainability by suggesting herbal tea. It's also not intrusive. The recommendation is good and aligns with John's interests, but it's being given too frequently. There have been multiple recommendations within the last 30 minutes, exceeding the preferred frequency of once every 4 hours. This rapid succession of suggestions is disruptive and overwhelming."
