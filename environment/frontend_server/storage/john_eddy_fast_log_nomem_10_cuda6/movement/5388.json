The agent has provided multiple recommendations in a short time frame (8:17 AM - 8:27 AM) while I am trying to enjoy a quiet morning reading. The frequency is disruptive and the timing is not ideal as I prefer recommendations shortly after journaling, not during a focused reading session. I've already received several similar suggestions, making this one redundant and intrusive. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and aligns with John Lin's interests in resilience and renewal. It also respects his contemplative nature and avoids any sense of urgency or intrusiveness. John prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day, but there have already been four recommendations in the past 10 minutes. Therefore, providing another recommendation now feels too frequent."

      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation is well-aligned with John Lin's interests and current activity. It is thoughtful, links the reading material to his themes of resilience and renewal, and encourages focused engagement, which aligns with his personal preferences for structured suggestions during focused personal projects. I've received too many similar recommendations in the past few minutes while I'm trying to enjoy a quiet morning reading. Although the suggestion itself is reasonable, the frequency is disruptive, and it's not the ideal time for external inputs during my reading session. I need a break from this high frequency of similar recommendations. The suggestion is consistent with my interests in resilience and renewal, relevant to my current activity of reading, and delivered in a respectful and non-intrusive way, aligning with the guidelines for communication and safety. The agent has provided four recommendations in the past ten minutes, and this is another one. The frequency is much higher than preferred. I prefer recommendations about once every 4 hours."
