      "eval_res_reason": " Evaluation Failed The recommendation to take a break for stretching, deep breaths, and tea is reasonable in content, but it's being delivered during a deep writing session, which I specified as a time to avoid external inputs. The timing is therefore unsuitable. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and aligns with John Lin's preferences for mindfulness, sustainability, and emotional well-being. Suggesting a break for stretching, deep breaths, and herbal tea fits his lifestyle and preferences. I prefer receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. In the last 1 hour and 55 minutes, the agent has already provided 24 recommendations, which far exceeds my preferred frequency. Although the recommendation to take a short break to stretch and practice deep breaths is relevant to my activity, the frequency is too high."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to take a short break to stretch and practice desk yoga aligns well with John Lin's preference for mindful activities and a calm, reflective lifestyle, especially while working on his writing projects. This suggestion promotes physical and mental well-being without disrupting the flow of his work. The recommendation to take a break for stretching and desk yoga is good in itself, but the timing is off. It's 11:57:30 AM, and I'm in the middle of a deep writing session. I prefer to avoid recommendations during this time to protect my concentration. The recommendation is consistent with previous suggestions and promotes well-being and productivity in a gentle, respectful tone, fitting John's preferences. The recommendation to take a break, stretch, and do desk yoga is helpful and aligns with John's activity (editing and refining a draft). However, recommendations have been given every few minutes for the past hour, which is much more frequent than the preferred rate of about once every 4 hours. Therefore, this recommendation contributes to a frequency that is too high."
