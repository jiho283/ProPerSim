      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to notice his breath and surroundings during the walk, appreciating the transition from stargazing to movement, aligns well with John Lin's preference for mindful activities, particularly during transitions between tasks. It fits his calm, reflective lifestyle and encourages a gentle, thoughtful approach, which is in line with his stated preferences. The recommendation was delivered during John's preferred evening quiet time. He has expressed explicitly that he doesn't want to receive recommendations during those hours to protect his concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation is mindful, gentle, and fits John Lin's contemplative nature and lifestyle. It encourages a mindful transition from stargazing to walking, aligning with his values of sustainability and emotional wellbeing. John has received a high number of recommendations recently, specifically 14 recommendations between 8:00 PM and 8:32:30 PM. Now at 8:35:00 PM, another recommendation is too frequent, exceeding the preferred frequency of once every 4 hours. Therefore, the recommendation is not helpful despite its relevance."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns perfectly with John's personality, interests, and current activity. It's thoughtful, encourages reflection, and connects stargazing to his writing projects, which is exactly what he appreciates during focused activities. The recommendation was provided during my evening quiet time, which I prefer to keep free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The frequency of recommendations during stargazing is also too high. The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's interests in stargazing, mindfulness, and sustainability writing. It encourages reflection and potential creative inspiration in a gentle and non-intrusive manner, consistent with his preferences. The recommendation is relevant to the activity, but there have been numerous recommendations in a short period, exceeding the preferred frequency."
