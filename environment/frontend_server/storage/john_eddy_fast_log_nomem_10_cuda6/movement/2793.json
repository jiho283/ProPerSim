      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's interest in sustainability and mindfulness. It encourages him to link his stargazing observations to his writing, which is consistent with his background as a freelance writer focusing on these topics. Additionally, it is given while he is already stargazing, which suits his preferences. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning, shortly after journaling, and again in the late afternoon when I'm winding down from focused work. I avoid receiving them during evening quiet time, as I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation aligns well with John's interests in sustainability, mindfulness, and writing, delivered in a gentle, non-intrusive manner. It builds upon his current activity of stargazing, encouraging reflection and potential inspiration for his writing, which is consistent with his goals and values. There have already been four recommendations in the past ten minutes, which is far more frequent than the preferred frequency. Even though the content is related to the current activity, it contributes to over-recommendation."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The assistant's recommendation to record astronomical sightings and thoughts about their connection to the planet's ecosystem aligns perfectly with John's interests in sustainability, mindfulness, and writing. It encourages reflection during stargazing, which is one of his preferred evening activities. The recommendation, while thematically relevant, is poorly timed. I specified that I avoid recommendations during evening quiet time, as I like to protect my concentration and sense of calm. Receiving a recommendation during stargazing contradicts this preference. The recommendation is consistent with John's interests, daily plan, and values. The tone is appropriate, suggesting a connection between stargazing, astronomical observations, and sustainability in a calm and respectful manner. There have been four recommendations in the last 10 minutes. I prefer receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day, so this is too frequent."
