It also supports his lifestyle of incorporating nature and reflection into his daily routine. Although the recommendation is good, I'm currently working on a draft for my creative project and prefer to avoid recommendations during deep writing sessions. The recommendation is consistent with the previous suggestions, promoting breaks for stretching and fresh air, which aligns with John Lin's values of mindfulness and well-being. Adding calm instrumental music is also a nice touch to boost creativity and focus, respecting his contemplative nature. The tone is gentle and encouraging. Since I prefer to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. I've already received multiple recommendations within the last hour; thus, this recommendation contributes to creating a frequency that is higher than the preferred frequency, so the score must be zero."

      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to listen to soft instrumental background music while working on the writing draft aligns well with John's preference for a calm and reflective lifestyle and enhancing focus during creative projects. It also follows a pattern of previous helpful suggestions regarding music and breaks. John Lin prefers to avoid receiving recommendations during deep writing sessions. The current recommendation is about listening to music while drafting, which falls under a deep writing session. Thus, the timing is not appropriate. The recommendation is aligned with John's preference for a gentle and calm tone, suggests something that promotes focus and creativity (soft instrumental music), and aligns with his interests in mindfulness and well-being. It's not intrusive or overly commercial. John has already received several suggestions within the last 10 minutes about taking breaks. Providing another suggestion now, even a different one like listening to music, contributes to a higher-than-preferred frequency of recommendations."
