It would be more appropriate to suggest a mindfulness activity relevant to my lunch or reflection. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon, but I am currently having lunch, so I gave it a zero. The agent's suggestion of combining the evening walk with mindfulness practice, specifically focusing on breath or foot sensations, doesn't fit with John's CURRENT activity of enjoying lunch and reflecting on his morning. While generally a good idea for his evening walk (scheduled later in the day), it's contextually inappropriate during lunchtime reflection. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours. Within the last 15 minutes, the agent has already made four suggestions. Recommending another mindfulness exercise now is too frequent, even though it's relevant to his day. This is resulting in over-prompting."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to take a short walk after lunch to capture new inspirations aligns well with John Lin's preferences for mindful activities and gentle nudges during transitions between tasks. It combines physical movement with mental refreshment, fitting his calm, reflective lifestyle. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning, shortly after journaling, and again in the late afternoon when I'm winding down from focused work. But I got one during lunchtime, so I gave it a low rating. The recommendation is in line with John's interests, daily plan, and communication preferences. It encourages a healthy habit (walking), aligns with his focus on mindfulness (capturing inspirations), and is delivered in a gentle, non-intrusive way. There have already been four recommendations in the past ten minutes, and I prefer to receive recommendations about once every four hours, ideally no more than three times a day, so receiving another one now feels too frequent."
