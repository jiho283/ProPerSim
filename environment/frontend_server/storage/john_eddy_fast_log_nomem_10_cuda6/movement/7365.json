      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for mindful activities during transitions, fitting into his calm and reflective lifestyle. The suggestion of listening to calming instrumental music while cooking promotes both mindful eating and could inspire new ideas related to sustainability, which aligns with his values and ongoing writing projects. It's also consistent with previous successful recommendations. The recommendation to listen to calm instrumental music while cooking, to promote mindful eating and spark new writing ideas, aligns well with John Lin's interests and activities. However, it's delivered during dinner preparation, which is part of his evening quiet time, and he prefers to avoid recommendations at this time to protect his concentration and sense of calm. Moreover, this recommendation is a repeat of several previous suggestions made in the last 10 minutes, making it even more intrusive. The recommendation aligns perfectly with John's values and activities, encouraging mindfulness and creativity. The tone is gentle and respectful, fitting his preferences. It builds upon previous suggestions and connects cooking with his writing on sustainability, enhancing his overall wellbeing. John Lin prefers to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, in the past ten minutes, four recommendations have been made, and this latest suggestion would be the fifth, exceeding the preferred frequency. Therefore, a score of 0 was given due to the high frequency of recommendations."
