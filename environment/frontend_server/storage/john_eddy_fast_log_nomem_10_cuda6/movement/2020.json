      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to play soft instrumental music while preparing lunch aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for a calm atmosphere and the use of music to enhance activities, as seen in his previous gardening and reading sessions. The suggestion is thoughtful and fits well with his reflective lifestyle. I'm in the middle of having lunch and planning my afternoon writing projects. I prefer recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, not during focused activities or meal times. The agent is making too many recommendations during lunch. The recommendation is consistent with previous suggestions (soothing music), aligns with John Lin's preference for a calm atmosphere, and connects to his mindfulness principles. The tone is gentle and respectful, fitting the communication preferences outlined. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. In the past 10 minutes (12:00PM - 12:10PM) there have been four recommendations already (12:00:00 PM, 12:02:30 PM, 12:05:00 PM, 12:07:30 PM), so another one now is too frequent."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to incorporate herbs from the garden into the meal is excellent. It aligns perfectly with John Lin's interests in gardening, sustainable living, and mindfulness. It also builds upon his earlier activity of tending to the garden, making it a thoughtful and relevant suggestion that enriches his daily routine. The suggestion perfectly aligns with his preference for thoughtful and aligned suggestions for his calm and reflective lifestyle. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning, shortly after journaling, and again in the late afternoon when winding down from focused work, but I received it during lunch, so I gave it a low rating. The suggestion is aligned with John's interests in gardening, sustainability, and mindfulness, plus the recommendation is respectful and calm. Four recommendations were provided within the past 7 minutes. Providing yet another recommendation now results in a frequency that is much higher than the preferred one. Therefore, a score of 0 was given."
