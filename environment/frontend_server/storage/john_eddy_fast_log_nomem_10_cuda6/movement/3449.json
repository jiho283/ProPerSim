      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation suggests reviewing yesterday's achievements and aligning them with today's objectives before setting intentions, which fits well with John Lin's preference for thoughtful, reflective activities during his bedtime routine. It encourages a mindful review of his progress, aligning with his values and fostering a sense of continuity and accomplishment, which he appreciates. The recommendation arrived at 11:40 PM, which falls within my evening quiet time when I prefer to avoid external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. Therefore, the timing is inappropriate. The recommendation aligns with John's routine of setting intentions, encourages reflection on achievements, and promotes mindfulness, all while maintaining a respectful and considerate tone. The recommendation is helpful, but there have been four recommendations in the past 13 minutes. This is far more frequent than the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours. Therefore, the recommendation receives a score of 0 due to the high frequency."

      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation encourages reflection on personal growth in relation to interconnectedness, aligning well with John's mindful lifestyle, focus on sustainability, and previous meditation practices. It fits the context of setting intentions for the next day and promotes thoughtful consideration. The recommendation was given at 11:42:30 PM, which is during John's bedtime routine. He prefers to avoid recommendations during evening quiet time to protect his sense of calm. The recommendation encourages reflection on the impact of goals on personal growth, aligning with John's mindfulness and sustainability principles and maintaining a gentle, respectful tone, fitting well with his evening reflection routine. The recommendation is relevant, but there have been several recommendations within the last hour. This exceeds the preferred frequency of about once every four hours, making the current recommendation too frequent."
