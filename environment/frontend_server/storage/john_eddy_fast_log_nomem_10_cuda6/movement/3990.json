      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to adjust the room temperature and sit comfortably near the candles aligns well with John Lin's preference for creating a calming and reflective environment before bedtime. It enhances the meditation session and is consistent with his lifestyle and mindfulness practices. The suggestion is also timely and contextually appropriate. The recommendation was given during my evening quiet time, which I prefer to keep free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. I only want recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and calm, aligning with John Lin's preferences. It suggests a simple adjustment to enhance the meditation experience without being intrusive or demanding. It also promotes comfort and relaxation, fitting with his values of mindfulness and emotional wellbeing. The recommendation is also very different from all of the previous recommendations, thus indicating a diversity of ideas from the assistant. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. There have been multiple recommendations in the past few minutes, far exceeding this preferred frequency. Therefore, even though the recommendation itself is relevant, its high frequency warrants a low score."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to lower the lights and turn off screens aligns perfectly with John Lin's preferences for a calming and reflective lifestyle, and it directly enhances his meditation session. It builds on previous suggestions and creates a more conducive environment for mindfulness, which aligns with his long-term goals and daily routine. The recommendation arrived during John's evening quiet time, a period he prefers to keep free from external inputs to protect his sense of calm. He specifically avoids recommendations during this time. The recommendation to lower lights and turn off screens is appropriate for enhancing a meditation session, aligns with John Lin's lifestyle, and is communicated in a gentle and respectful manner. Given that there have been numerous recommendations in the last hour while winding down, including at 10:05:00 PM, 10:07:30 PM, 10:10:00 PM and 10:12:30 PM, this recommendation is too frequent and disrupts the preferred frequency."
