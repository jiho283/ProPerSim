      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to play soothing instrumental music while cooking aligns with John Lin's preference for a calm and reflective lifestyle. It also builds upon previous suggestions, showing continuity and understanding of his preferences. Additionally, it's timed appropriately during meal preparation, enhancing the overall experience with a mindful element. I avoid receiving recommendations during evening quiet time, such as when preparing dinner at 6:35 PM. I prefer to keep this space free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation is delivered in a gentle and respectful tone, aligning with my communication preferences. It also connects to my interests in mindfulness and sustainability by suggesting calming music and sustainable dishes, thus respecting my values and promoting emotional well-being. The recommendation about playing calming music while cooking is relevant and aligns with John's interest in mindfulness. However, it's the second time this specific suggestion has been made within the past ten minutes, and it's exceeding his preferred recommendation frequency of about once every 4 hours (ideally no more than three times a day). Therefore, the recommendation, while useful in isolation, contributes to over-prompting."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to play soothing background music with nature sounds while preparing dinner aligns well with John Lin's preference for a calm, reflective lifestyle and mindful activities. It connects with his interests in sustainability and mindfulness, creating a relaxing ambiance during meal preparation. The recommendation to play soothing music is a good suggestion given my interest in mindfulness and relaxation. However, the timing is not ideal. I prefer recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon when I'm winding down from focused work. Receiving this during dinner preparation is disruptive and doesn't align with my preferred schedule. The suggestion is aligned with John's preferences for calming music and mindfulness, and it is communicated in a gentle and respectful tone, fitting the communication and safety guidelines. There have been four recommendations in the last ten minutes, which is much higher than the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours. Even though the recommendation is relevant to the current activity, it's too frequent."
