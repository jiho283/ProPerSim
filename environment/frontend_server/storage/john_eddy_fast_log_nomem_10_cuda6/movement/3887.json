      "eval_res_score": "3.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's interests and ongoing activities. He is gardening, and the suggestion to connect the decomposition process in composting to themes of renewal in his writing is relevant, reflective, and in line with his focus on sustainability and mindfulness. John prefers recommendations in the late afternoon when winding down from focused work. It is 5:55 PM, and he is winding down by gardening. The recommendation also fits his interests, therefore I will give a score of 1. The recommendation is aligned with John Lin's interests in sustainability, mindfulness, and writing. It is phrased gently and respectfully, encouraging him to reflect on the composting process and relate it to broader themes in his writing. It also connects his gardening activity with his writing projects, which is consistent with previous successful recommendations. The recommendation is relevant and insightful, but based on the memory, recommendations are being given far more frequently than my preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours. There have been a very high number of recommendations given today overall, and multiple given within the last few minutes. Therefore, this recommendation contributes to an unacceptably high frequency."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation is well-aligned with John Lin's preferences. It encourages reflection on the connection between gardening and his writing, which fits his interest in sustainability and mindfulness. The suggestion is thoughtful, calm, and encourages mindful activity during a transition (gardening), perfectly suiting his preferred style. John prefers recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon. The current recommendation is given at 5:57:30 PM, which falls within the late afternoon, which is a preferred time. However, the frequency of recommendations in the recent past (24 in the last hour) suggests John is being overwhelmed. Therefore, while the time itself is okay, given how many recommendations he has recently gotten, it is too much. The recommendation aligns well with John's interests in sustainability, mindfulness, and writing. It's delivered in a gentle tone, encouraging reflection and metaphorical thinking, which suits his contemplative nature. It is related to his current action and aligns with the communication and safety guidelines. There have been five recommendations within the past ten minutes. This is significantly more frequent than my preference of about once every four hours, ideally no more than three times a day. Therefore, even if the recommendation is relevant, the frequency is too high."
