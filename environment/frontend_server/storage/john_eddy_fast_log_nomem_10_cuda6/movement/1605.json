The recommendation is also too similar to recent suggestions. The suggestion aligns with John's values of mindful dining and savoring the experience, and the tone is gentle and respectful, fitting the Communication & Safety guidelines. The recommendation is well-aligned with John's activities and interests, promoting mindfulness and appreciation during meal preparation. However, this recommendation is being given too frequently. In the past ten minutes, there have already been four recommendations, exceeding the preferred frequency."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for mindful activities during meal preparation. It's a gentle nudge to appreciate the food, aligning with his reflective lifestyle. I don't want to receive recommendations when preparing dinner, as I prefer to keep my concentration and sense of calm. It is best to receive recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon. The recommendation aligns with John Lin's interests in mindfulness and sustainability, delivered in a gentle and respectful tone. It encourages him to engage his senses and appreciate the experience of preparing his meal, which is consistent with his contemplative nature. The recommendation aligns with the current activity and is helpful, but the agent has already provided multiple recommendations within a short time frame during dinner preparation. This suggests a frequency that is higher than John Lin's preference, warranting a score of 0."
