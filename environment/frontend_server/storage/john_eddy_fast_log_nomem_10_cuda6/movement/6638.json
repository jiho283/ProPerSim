      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to notice the surroundings and stop near a plant or flower aligns perfectly with John's preference for mindful activities and seeking inspiration from nature. It's also well-timed, as he's already taking a walk to get fresh air. John Lin prefers to receive recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon. Given that he is currently having lunch and taking a short break, it is not the preferred time for recommendations. Also, this suggestion closely mirrors previous suggestions made during lunch break, making it unnecessarily repetitive. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and calm, aligning with John's preference. It also respects his contemplative nature and provides a helpful suggestion that connects with his interests in nature and creativity. It encourages mindfulness and doesn't come across as intrusive or demanding. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, there have already been four recommendations in the past 10 minutes (12:25:00 PM to 12:35:00 PM), so receiving another one now feels too frequent, which is why I gave a low score for frequency."
