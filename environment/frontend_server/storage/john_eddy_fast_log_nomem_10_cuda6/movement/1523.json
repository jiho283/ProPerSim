I prefer to avoid receiving recommendations during deep writing sessions, as I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration. I am writing the main body of the article. The recommendation is gentle, relevant to John's needs while writing, and aligns with his preference for staying hydrated with water or herbal tea. It is delivered in a non-intrusive way, respecting his contemplative nature. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, since 3 PM, there have already been four recommendations. Therefore, receiving another recommendation now is too frequent."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to take a brief break for stretching and refocusing aligns well with John's preferences for mindful activities and maintaining focus during writing projects. The suggestion is simple, practical, and promotes a calm and reflective lifestyle. According to the timing instructions, I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning, shortly after journaling, and again in the late afternoon when I'm winding down from focused work. I avoid receiving them during deep writing sessions. Currently, I'm in a deep writing session, so I don't want to receive recommendations. The agent's recommendation aligns well with my preferences for gentle, respectful communication. It suggests a break for stretching and refocusing, which is consistent with my mindfulness practices and avoids any intrusive or overly commercial content. The suggestion also directly relates to my current activity of writing the article's main body and matches the daily plan. John is trying to write, and the assistant has given multiple similar recommendations in the last few minutes. This is far too frequent, so this recommendation gets a 0. The content of the recommendation is fine, but the frequency is the main factor here."
