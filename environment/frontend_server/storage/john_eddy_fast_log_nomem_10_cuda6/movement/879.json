      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to notice the sounds around while eating, and potentially adding outdoor recordings, aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for mindful activities, reflective lifestyle, and sensory enrichment during meals. It is a gentle nudge that fits well with his routine and enhances the dining experience without being intrusive. The recommendation aligns with my mindful lunch practice and the suggestion to incorporate sensory awareness during meals. The timing is also appropriate, as it's during lunchtime, and the recommendation to notice sounds enhances the overall dining experience, aligning with my focus on flavors and textures. The recommendation aligns well with John's mindfulness practices during lunch, suggesting a sensory enhancement (sounds) that fits his established routine and preferences. It maintains a calm and respectful tone, respecting his contemplative nature, and promotes emotional wellbeing by suggesting immersion in a sensory experience. John Lin prefers receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, the agent has already made four recommendations between 12:25 PM and 12:35 PM while he is having lunch. Therefore, providing another recommendation now exceeds the preferred frequency."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to notice the aroma of the food and how it complements the ambiance aligns well with John Lin's mindful approach to eating and his overall lifestyle. It's a gentle suggestion that encourages sensory awareness and enhances the dining experience, fitting with his preference for calm, reflective activities. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, and I avoid receiving them during focused work or evening quiet time. Now I am having lunch, so I don't want to get any recommendations. The agent's recommendation to notice the aroma of food complements the ambiance fits well with John Lin's mindful eating habits and aligns with his values of sustainability and mindfulness. The tone is gentle and non-intrusive, fostering emotional wellbeing and respecting his contemplative nature. John prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day, but the assistant has provided four recommendations within the past 10 minutes, and many more throughout the morning. This recommendation, while relevant to the activity, contributes to excessive prompting, which is undesirable."
