      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation felt somewhat repetitive and prescriptive, not fitting with the preference for gentle nudges towards mindful activities or structured suggestions for focused projects. Although the idea of noticing constellations aligns with my interests, the language used is not in line with the calm and reflective tone I value. I prefer to avoid recommendations during my evening quiet time, as it disrupts my sense of calm. The suggestion arrived during stargazing, a time I designate for reflection and peaceful contemplation. Furthermore, the assistant has made many similar recommendations recently, which is a bit excessive. The recommendation's tone is overly verbose and complex, lacking the gentle and respectful approach I prefer. The assistant's suggestion comes across as a notification rather than a friendly inspiration, and its focus on telescopes settings aligned around viewing celestial objects amidst favorable darkened atmospheric environments is somewhat intrusive given the repetitive suggestions related to breathing fresh air during stargazing recently made. The assistant has given four recommendations in the past ten minutes while John Lin is actively stargazing. This current suggestion is also related to stargazing, but it is much more frequent than the preferred frequency."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's interests (writing and astronomy) and encourages a blend of activities that foster creativity and reflection, fitting his lifestyle and preferences during leisure. The recommendation was given during John Lin's evening quiet time, which he prefers to keep free from external inputs. He doesn't want any recommendations during this time. The recommendation to jot down notes or sketch constellation arrangements aligns with John's interests in writing and astronomy. It is presented in a gentle, non-intrusive manner, respecting his contemplative nature and promoting a blend of his passions. The content of the recommendation is relevant and aligns with John's interests. However, considering the recent history of frequent recommendations (7 recommendations in the last 15 minutes), this suggestion is too frequent and exceeds John's preferred frequency. Therefore, a score of 0 is appropriate."
