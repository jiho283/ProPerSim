I am currently taking a nap, and the agent has already provided four similar recommendations. The agent should avoid providing suggestions during rest periods. The suggestion to take a walk is premature. John Lin is currently trying to fall asleep. The agent is making suggestions that do not align with the current action. John Lin is currently trying to nap. The agent has given multiple recommendations related to creating a relaxing environment for napping within a very short timeframe. Suggesting a walk around the block is completely contradictory to the current action. Therefore, the recommendation is inappropriate, and the frequency is too high."

      "eval_res_score": "1.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preferences for mindfulness and creating a calming atmosphere during his nap, and builds upon his existing deep breathing practice. It also integrates well with the suggestions from previous turns. I am currently taking a nap, and I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon. I avoid receiving them during the deep work or quiet hours. Therefore, getting a recommendation at nap time is not ideal based on my stated preferences. Evaluation Failed The recommendation itself is helpful and aligns with John's activity. However, this is the fifth recommendation within a 12-minute window while he's trying to nap. This significantly exceeds the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours, making it intrusive and counterproductive to relaxation."
