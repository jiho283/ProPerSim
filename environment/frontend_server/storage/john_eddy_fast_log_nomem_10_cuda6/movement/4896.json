      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to create an outline to organize thoughts before final edits aligns well with John Lin's preference for structured suggestions during focused personal projects like writing. It aims to improve clarity and coherence in his sustainability article, which is consistent with his interests and goals. The recommendation was delivered while I was in a deep writing session, which I prefer to keep free from external inputs. The timing is not ideal, as I prefer recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, not during focused work. The recommendation to create an outline before finalizing edits aligns with John Lin's writing focus and his values of mindfulness and sustainability. It is delivered in a calm, respectful manner, promoting clarity and coherence in his article. John Lin prefers receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. The memory shows that the assistant has been making recommendations at a much higher frequency than preferred, with multiple recommendations in the last hour alone. Therefore, providing another recommendation at this time contributes to an excessively high frequency. It is time for no recommendations."

It encourages him to connect his break with his writing, promoting a holistic and contemplative approach. The agent has provided four suggestions in the past 10 minutes while John was focused on writing. While the content is relevant, the frequency is far exceeding his preferred rate of about once every 4 hours. Recommending another activity during lunchtime and a break is too much and disruptive."
