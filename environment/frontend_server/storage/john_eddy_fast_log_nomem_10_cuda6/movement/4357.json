      "eval_res_score": "1.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to focus on surroundings during a walk, while generally aligned with mindfulness, seems repetitive given the previous recommendations for similar activities. It doesn't add a novel or insightful suggestion to John's writing process, and lacks the structured guidance he appreciates during focused work. The recommendation was given during a deep writing session, which I prefer to avoid. I prefer getting recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, not during focused work time. The agent's recommendation is well-aligned with John's personality and daily plan. It encourages reflection and drawing inspiration from nature, which fits his interests and the theme of his writing. The tone is gentle and respectful, consistent with the communication preferences. It also promotes sustainability and mindfulness, ensuring emotional well-being and avoiding intrusive content. The recommendation is related to John's current activity, but there have been four recommendations in the past 10 minutes, which is far more frequent than preferred. Therefore, despite the helpful nature of the suggestion, the excessive frequency warrants a score of 0."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to take a short break and gaze out the window or walk in the garden aligns perfectly with my preference for mindful activities during transitions, helping me refresh and find connections within my writing on sustainability. It matches the gentle nudges I like and supports a calm, reflective lifestyle. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon. This recommendation came during a deep writing session, which is not my preferred time. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and calm, aligning with John's preference for a friendly and inspiring tone. It suggests a brief break in nature to refresh the mind and spark new connections, which aligns with his values of sustainability and mindfulness. The suggestion is also contextually relevant, as it relates to his current task of drafting an article on sustainability and mindfulness. The recommendation is relevant, but the frequency is too high. There have been several recommendations within the past 10 minutes, which is far more frequent than the preferred rate of about once every 4 hours."
