      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preferences for a calming nighttime routine and reflective activities before sleep. Suggesting a personally crafted affirmation related to productivity and focus reinforces positivity, which supports his goals of encouraging sustainable living and leading a peaceful life. It builds upon the previous suggestions for journaling and setting intentions, providing a concrete way to enhance the process. The recommendation came at 11:32:30 PM, which is during John's bedtime routine and considered evening quiet time. He prefers to avoid recommendations during this time to protect his concentration and sense of calm. Therefore, the timing is inappropriate, even if the suggestion itself is relevant to his current activity. The recommendation aligns well with John's established routine of reflection and intention-setting, fitting seamlessly into his evening activities. The suggested affirmation regarding productivity and focus is relevant, respecting his mindfulness practices without feeling intrusive. The gentle tone mirrors a friend's supportive inspiration, enhancing emotional well-being and sustainability principles. There have been frequent recommendations in the last 30 minutes before going to bed. The recommendation, although helpful, contributes to creating a frequency that is higher than the preferred frequency, so the score is zero."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The agent's recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preference for thoughtful and aligned activities by suggesting a visualization exercise to boost motivation and clarity during intention-setting. This suggestion fits his calm and reflective lifestyle and encourages a mindful approach to preparing for sleep. John prefers to avoid recommendations during evening quiet time, as he likes to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect his concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation was given at 11:35 PM. This is part of his evening quiet time. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, calm, and aligns with John Lin's principles of sustainability, mindfulness, and emotional wellbeing. It encourages a positive and proactive approach to the next day. John Lin prefers receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, there have been 14 recommendations in the past 35 minutes, receiving another one now feels far too frequent."
