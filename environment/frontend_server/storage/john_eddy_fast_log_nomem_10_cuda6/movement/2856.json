      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns perfectly with John Lin's personal preference for thoughtful suggestions related to mindfulness and reflection, especially during his wind-down routine. Jotting down grateful thoughts in a journal to solidify them and reflect on their contribution to overall well-being fits well with his values and lifestyle. The recommendation to journal about gratitude is good in content but poorly timed. It's during his evening quiet time, which he prefers to keep free from external inputs. He also stated that he avoids receiving recommendations during this time to protect his concentration and sense of calm. The agent's recommendation is gentle, respectful, and aligns with John Lin's principles of sustainability, mindfulness, and emotional well-being. It also encourages reflection and solidifies the positive impact of his gratitude practice. The recommendation aligns with John's current activity of reflecting on positive moments and expressing gratitude during meditation. However, this is the fourth recommendation in the last seven minutes of the same activity and within the same evening, which significantly exceeds his preferred frequency of once every 4 hours, or no more than three times a day. Therefore, the score is zero due to the excessive frequency."

      "eval_res_score": "1.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to notice the sensation of feet touching the ground and sounds is aligned with his preference for mindful activities during transitions, especially while preparing for bed by tidying up, which aims to create a serene environment. It promotes calm and reflection, fitting his lifestyle and the activity. The recommendation arrived at 11:00 PM, which is during my preferred evening quiet time. I avoid external inputs then to protect my calm. Therefore, the timing is inappropriate. The recommendation to notice the sensation of feet touching the ground and sounds is out of sync with the current action which is tidying up the living room to create a serene environment. The suggestion feels more appropriate for a walk than for preparing the living room for sleep.  There have been many recommendations in the last hour, which is more frequent than my preferred frequency. So, I gave it a score of zero."
