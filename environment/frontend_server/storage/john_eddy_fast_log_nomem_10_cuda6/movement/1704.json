It also builds upon prior successful recommendations regarding gratitude and intention setting. The recommendation was given during John Lin's evening quiet time, which he prefers to keep free from external inputs to protect his concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation aligns with John Lin's interests in mindfulness and positive intentions, communicated gently and respectfully. It builds on previous suggestions for journaling and gratitude, and avoids any intrusive or overly commercial content. I prefer to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, the assistant has provided four recommendations in the past 10 minutes during my quiet reflection and meditation time. This is far more frequent than preferred. Therefore, despite the content being helpful, it contributes to excessive recommendations."
