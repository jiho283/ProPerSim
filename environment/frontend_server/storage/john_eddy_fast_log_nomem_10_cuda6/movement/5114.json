I prefer to avoid recommendations during evening quiet time, as I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation came during my evening walk, which is part of my unwinding process. The recommendation aligns well with John's personality and interests. It's gentle, respectful, and encourages mindful observation, fitting perfectly with his contemplative nature and focus on sustainability and mindfulness. It builds upon his current activity without being intrusive. The assistant has provided frequent recommendations over the past several minutes. The frequency is far exceeding the preferred rate of about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. A recommendation about every 2.5 minutes is far too high a frequency."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preference for mindful activities during transitions, especially when engaging with nature. Suggesting he notices scents and textures and then journals about his impressions fits his reflective lifestyle and his interest in weaving together observations and creative expression. The recommendation was given during evening quiet time when I don't want to receive recommendations. The recommendation is consistent with John's interests, preferences, and the previous interactions. It suggests journaling about his impressions, weaving together observation, reflection, and creative expression, which aligns perfectly with his lifestyle and goals. The tone is also gentle and respectful, fitting his preferences. In the past 10 minutes, there have been four recommendations while I am taking an evening walk. This frequency is excessively high, contradicting my stated preference for recommendations approximately once every 4 hours. Therefore, this recommendation is not helpful and disrupts my reflective state during the walk."
