      "eval_res_score": "0.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " This recommendation doesn't align well with the current action. John Lin is preparing lunch, and being told to observe the environment for inspiration while walking seems out of place. It's too similar to previous suggestions during his writing/gardening time, and doesn't offer a new or helpful perspective in this context. It feels like a repetitive suggestion without considering the change in activity. John Lin is preparing lunch, and he prefers recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, not during focused activities or mealtimes. The timing is inappropriate. The recommendation suggests finding inspiration for writing or gardening while preparing lunch. This feels disconnected and unrelated to the current activity. The assistant seems to be just throwing out ideas without considering the context of lunch preparation, which is separate from his morning routine of writing/gardening. The recommendation is helpful but comes too soon after several others (reflected in the memory summary: 'Number of Recommendation: 95' and 'Number of Recommendation: 24' within the morning) creating a frequency much higher than preferred. John is also about to have lunch, an activity that doesn't necessarily require creative inspiration or observation. Therefore, a recommendation about finding inspiration is unnecessary and too frequent."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to play calm background music while cooking aligns well with John Lin's preference for a calm, reflective lifestyle and maintaining a relaxing atmosphere, similar to his morning study sessions. It is a gentle nudge that fits the transition between tasks. John Lin doesn't want to get recommendations during lunchtime, as he likes to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect his concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation was delivered at 12:02:30 PM, which is during his lunch time. The recommendation is gentle and aligns with John Lin's preferences for a relaxing atmosphere, referencing his previous morning routine. It's also emotionally considerate and avoids intrusive content. The recommendation is helpful, but it is being provided at a higher frequency than preferred. There have been 4 recommendations in the past hour, so a score of 0 was given due to high frequency."
