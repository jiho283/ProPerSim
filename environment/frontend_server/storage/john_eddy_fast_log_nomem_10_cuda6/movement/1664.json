      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns perfectly with John Lin's personal preference for mindful activities during transitions (walking in the garden) and his appreciation for creative prompts to enhance his writing. It is thoughtful, calm, and encourages reflection and inspiration from nature, fitting his lifestyle and interests. The recommendation arrives during John's preferred quiet time, which he uses for unwinding. The timing is inappropriate and disrupts his concentration and sense of calm, especially since he mentioned that he avoids receiving recommendations during evening quiet time. The recommendation is aligned with John's interests in mindfulness, nature, and writing. The tone is gentle and encouraging, respecting his contemplative nature. It encourages observation and creativity without being intrusive or demanding. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. Given the high frequency of recommendations in the past hour, this recommendation contributes to an excessive frequency. Thus, a score of 0 is appropriate."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to notice the sensation of feet on the ground and take deeper breaths aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for mindful activities during his evening walk and reflects his interest in mindfulness and reflection, which are central to his lifestyle and writing focus. I prefer to avoid receiving recommendations during evening quiet time, as I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. I only prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning, shortly after journaling, and again in the late afternoon when winding down from focused work. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and calm, aligning with John's contemplative nature and promoting mindfulness and emotional wellbeing. It encourages him to connect with the present moment and the serenity of his garden, fitting his lifestyle and principles. John Lin has received several recommendations during his short evening walk. Receiving another one now, just two and a half minutes after the last, makes the frequency far exceed the preferred frequency. The content may be useful, but the timing is off."
