      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to tie astronomical discoveries to sustainability and eco-conscious writing aligns perfectly with my background, interests, and current activities. It combines the stargazing I'm currently doing with my freelance writing focus on sustainability, and encourages thoughtful reflection, which is in line with my preference for a calm and reflective lifestyle. The recommendation was delivered while I was stargazing and reflecting, which falls under my 'evening quiet time' when I prefer to avoid external inputs. Additionally, the suggestion to connect philosophical readings and stargazing to my writing feels like work intruding on my relaxation. This is the opposite of what I am trying to do during this time. The recommendation aligns well with my interests in philosophy, stargazing, and sustainability writing. It encourages me to connect these interests in a meaningful way, which is consistent with my contemplative nature and principles. The tone is also gentle and respectful. There have already been four recommendations in the past ten minutes. John prefers to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. This recommendation is being provided at a much higher frequency than preferred, which is why it received a score of zero."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to add a sketch or doodle to my astronomical observations aligns well with my preferences. I enjoy reflective activities and appreciate the suggestion to combine art with contemplation, which fits my interest in mindfulness and creative expression. This suggestion encourages a peaceful and enriching experience during my stargazing, supporting my lifestyle and values. The recommendation was made during evening quiet time, which I prefer to keep free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation is aligned with John Lin's interests in both mindfulness and creative expression. The suggestion is gentle, respectful, and relevant to his current activity of stargazing and journaling, and encourages further exploration in a non-intrusive manner. The recommendation to add a sketch or doodle related to astronomical observations is relevant to John Lin's current activity and interests. However, this is the fifth recommendation within the last ten minutes, greatly exceeding his preferred frequency of about once every four hours. Therefore, the recommendation is too frequent, leading to a score of 0."
