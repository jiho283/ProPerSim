The recommendation is also too similar to recent suggestions. The suggestion aligns with John's values of mindful dining and savoring the experience, and the tone is gentle and respectful, fitting the Communication & Safety guidelines. The recommendation is well-aligned with John's activities and interests, promoting mindfulness and appreciation during meal preparation. However, this recommendation is being given too frequently. In the past ten minutes, there have already been four recommendations, exceeding the preferred frequency."
