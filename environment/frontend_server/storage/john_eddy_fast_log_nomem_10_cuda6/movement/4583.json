      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to prioritize tasks promoting mindful consumption or sustainable living aligns perfectly with John Lin's lifestyle, long-term goals, and current interests, especially when setting intentions for the next day. It builds upon his evening reflection and journaling, and it encourages him to translate his values into practical actions, which he appreciates. The recommendation arrived during my designated evening quiet time, which I prefer to keep free from external inputs. It is too close to bedtime, and the frequency of recommendations is high, so I gave it a low rating. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and aligned with John's principles of sustainability and mindfulness. It also builds on the current action of setting intentions for the next day, fitting seamlessly into his routine. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, but he has already received numerous recommendations in the last hour. This suggestion, while relevant to setting intentions for the next day, contributes to an unacceptably high frequency of recommendations, hence the score of 0."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to review philosophical reading goals and connect them with intentions aligns perfectly with John's preference for thoughtful, reflective activities before bed. It seamlessly blends his interests in philosophy and mindfulness, promoting a calm and intentional approach to the next day. It also fits into the specific scenario. The timing is not appropriate. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, but not during my evening quiet time. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and calm, aligning with John's preference for a friendly and inspirational tone. It connects to his philosophical readings and encourages mindful application, which aligns with his interests and principles of sustainability and mindfulness. It's emotionally considerate and avoids intrusive content. The recommendation is relevant, but there have been four recommendations within the last ten minutes, exceeding the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours. Therefore, a score of 0 is given."
