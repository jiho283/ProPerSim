Also, the agent suggested similar activities earlier. The suggestion is repetitive and not well-targeted. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon, but the assistant gave me a recommendation at lunchtime, which is not my preferred time. I am also concentrating on preparing food for lunch. The assistant seems to be confusing actions from the 'Evening walk' part of my plan with the current action of 'having lunch in his kitchen (cooking his meal)'. The recommendation is unrelated to the task and doesn't make sense in this context. John is in the kitchen making lunch. The assistant has already made four recommendations related to enhancing the cooking experience with music in the past 12 minutes. Recommending an outdoor activity for inspiration feels irrelevant to the current action and contributes to an excessive recommendation frequency."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The agent's recommendation to play gentle jazz while cooking aligns well with John Lin's preference for a calm, reflective lifestyle and maintaining a relaxed ambiance, similar to his morning routine. The suggestion is thoughtful and connects his current activity with past activities he found beneficial, thereby supporting his intention to stay grounded and mindful. The recommendation is coming during lunch preparation. According to the timing, John Lin prefers recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, but not during times he's deeply focused or during evening quiet time. This recommendation falls outside his preferred window, and he may be somewhat focused while cooking. The suggestion to play gentle jazz music aligns well with John Lin's preference for a calming atmosphere and his past enjoyment of music during meditation and creative projects. The tone is gentle and respectful, as requested, and the suggestion is relevant to the current activity of cooking lunch. The recommendation to listen to jazz music is relevant, but it's the fifth recommendation in the last 10 minutes during lunchtime, which is far more frequent than preferred (once every 4 hours, max 3 times a day). This excessive prompting disrupts the desired balance of suggestions and stillness."
