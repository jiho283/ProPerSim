      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John's reflective lifestyle and encourages him to capture astronomical observations and inspirational thoughts. This fits his preference for structured suggestions during focused personal projects, enriching his stargazing experience with potential connections to his writing. The timing is not ideal. I prefer to avoid recommendations during evening quiet time as I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. Evaluation Failed John Lin prefers receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, there have been 5 recommendations in the past ten minutes during stargazing. Receiving another one now makes the recommendations too frequent, so I gave it a score of zero."
