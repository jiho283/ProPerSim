      "eval_res_score": "0.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation suggests taking a walk and noticing surroundings, which is out of sync with the action of relaxing and watching TV indoors. While mindfulness is appreciated, a walk is not suitable for the current action. It does not take into account I am indoors now and want to watch tv. I prefer to avoid receiving recommendations during evening quiet time, as I like to keep that space free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. I was relaxing and watching TV. The suggestion to 'Take a few minutes to breathe deeply and notice your surrounding environment as you walk' is inappropriate in this context, as John Lin is about to relax and watch TV indoors. Suggesting a walk at this point does not align with his intended activity and is therefore not relevant. Given the high number of recommendations received in the last hour, even though the content of the recommendation is generally aligned with John Lin's activities, it's being provided at a higher frequency than preferred. Continuing to offer recommendations at this rate could overwhelm him and detract from his mindful practices. Therefore, a score of 0 is given."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's interests in sustainability and mindfulness, offering a way to connect his relaxation time with his core values. It is a thoughtful suggestion that complements his lifestyle and desire for learning. John prefers to avoid recommendations during evening quiet time. Recommending a documentary while he's settling in to watch TV conflicts with his preference for a distraction-free evening. The recommendation is relevant to John Lin's interests in sustainability and mindfulness, aligning with his values. It is also presented in a non-intrusive way, which respects his contemplative nature. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, but the assistant has made multiple recommendations within a short period. This recommendation, while relevant to his interests, contributes to an excessive frequency, so I gave a score of zero."
