      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns perfectly with John Lin's current action of taking an evening walk in his backyard and reflecting on the day. It encourages him to observe a plant and write down observations, connecting nature with his writing on sustainability, which fits his interests and values. I prefer to avoid receiving recommendations during evening quiet time as it interrupts my sense of calm, therefore I rated this suggestion low due to poor timing. The recommendation aligns well with John's interests in sustainability, mindfulness, and writing. It encourages reflection and observation in a gentle and respectful manner, perfectly fitting his contemplative nature and his current action of walking in the garden. The suggestion is also safe, ethically consistent, and emotionally considerate. The recommendation is helpful and relevant to John's current activity, but it is being provided far too frequently. There have been 4 recommendations in the past 10 minutes, and John prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns perfectly with John Lin's evening walk activity, encouraging mindful observation of his garden and connecting it to his writing on sustainability and self-care. This reflects his preference for thoughtful and reflective suggestions during transitions and quiet moments. The recommendation was given during my evening quiet time, which I prefer to keep free from external inputs. I only want recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon. The suggestion aligns perfectly with John Lin's established routine, interests, and values. It's delivered in a respectful and calm tone, promoting reflection and interconnectedness, as requested in the communication guidelines. Since I prefer to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, but there have already been four recommendations in the past twelve minutes, receiving another one now feels too frequent, which is why I gave a low score for frequency."
