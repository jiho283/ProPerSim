While the recommendation itself aligns with my preferences for mindfulness and connecting with nature, the frequency makes it feel repetitive and less thoughtful. I'm trying to wrap up my work, and the constant interruptions are hindering my focus rather than helping me refresh my perspective. The agent has been repeatedly suggesting the same break to observe the garden within a short time frame (4:00 PM - 4:10 PM). Although the content of the recommendation aligns with my interests, the frequency is disruptive and unwanted at this time, and I am winding down from my focused work, so it should not be given based on my preferences.  The assistant is repeating the same suggestion over and over again, even though I am still in the same action. This is not helpful and becomes annoying. There have been four recommendations in the past ten minutes, all suggesting I take a break to observe the garden. This is far too frequent and disrupts my focus, so I gave a score of 0 due to the excessive frequency."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The agent's recommendation is well-aligned with my preferences. I like gentle nudges for mindful activities when transitioning between tasks. Suggesting a break to stretch and gaze at the garden while wrapping up writing is thoughtful and promotes a calm, reflective lifestyle, which fits well with my values. The assistant agent has suggested taking a break to view the garden repetitively within a short time frame. I am also wrapping up my writing work, and I would like to focus on it to ensure its clarity and coherence rather than being distracted by external inputs. The recommendation is consistent with previous suggestions, promoting mindfulness and integrating John's garden into his work routine. The language used is gentle and respectful, aligning with John's preferences. The suggestion of stretching and gazing out the window is a practical and helpful break that doesn't introduce any safety concerns. John Lin prefers recommendations approximately every 4 hours and there have been four recommendations within the last ten minutes regarding taking a short break to observe the garden. This indicates the current recommendation would exceed the desired frequency, and therefore deserves a lower score."
