      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to listen to soft instrumental music while preparing lunch aligns well with John Lin's preference for a calm and reflective lifestyle. It also subtly encourages him to connect the music to his sustainable living project, which fits his values. The recommendation was given while I was preparing lunch, which doesn't align with my preferred timings of early morning or late afternoon. I prefer to avoid recommendations during focused activities like writing or even during my evening quiet time. Therefore, despite the content being potentially relevant, the timing makes it inappropriate. The recommendation aligns perfectly with John's preferences: gentle tone, promotes mindfulness, and links to his sustainability project. It's a safe and relevant suggestion for lunchtime. The recommendation is good, but considering the number of recommendations already received between 8:00 AM and 12:02:30 PM, and the two additional recommendations at 12:00 PM and 12:02:30 PM, this one at 12:05:00 PM is too frequent and exceeds the preferred frequency."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John's preference for a calm and reflective lifestyle. Suggesting soft instrumental music while preparing lunch is a thoughtful and mindful suggestion that encourages a calming atmosphere and could potentially inspire his writing on sustainable living. The recommendation is also well-timed during a break, as per his preferences. John is having lunch and taking a short break to recharge. He prefers recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, but not during lunchtime. Also, this recommendation overlaps significantly with previous ones (listening to music while cooking). The recommendation to listen to soft instrumental music while cooking aligns with John's preference for a calm atmosphere, his focus on sustainability through his writings, and the request for gentle, respectful suggestions. There have been many recommendations in the last 15 minutes, so a score of 0 was given due to the excessive frequency."
