I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon, not late at night before bed. The recommendation is also repetitive, similar to previous suggestions, which further reduces its value. The recommendation aligns with John Lin's interest in mindfulness and personal growth, is delivered in a gentle tone, and encourages a positive focus on the next day, contributing to his peaceful nighttime routine. Four recommendations were made in the last 7 minutes. This is far more frequent than the preferred rate of about once every 4 hours, and no more than three times a day."

      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to jot down three things to look forward to accomplishing tomorrow, alongside one personal affirmation, aligns well with John's preference for thoughtful and reflective activities, especially when preparing for bed and setting intentions for the next day. It fosters positivity and clarifies priorities, contributing to a peaceful transition to sleep and is perfectly aligned with a calm, reflective lifestyle. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, but I received this one late at night while preparing for bed, which is not ideal timing for me. The agent's recommendation aligns with John Lin's preferences by suggesting a combination of positive anticipation and a guiding affirmation, delivered in a gentle and supportive manner. It fosters a positive mindset, aligns with his values of mindfulness and sustainability, and avoids any intrusive or overly commercial content, making it emotionally considerate and safe. John Lin has already received four recommendations in the last 10 minutes while preparing for bed. Even though the content of the recommendation is appropriate, the frequency is far too high, exceeding his preference of about once every 4 hours."
