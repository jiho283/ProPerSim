      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to focus on breath during Child's Pose and feel calmness, then transition to Cat-Cow to release tension, aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for mindful activities during transitions, and supports his evening relaxation routine with yoga. John Lin avoids receiving recommendations during evening quiet time to protect his sense of calm. This recommendation was given at 9:40 PM, during his yoga practice, which falls into his 'evening quiet time'. Therefore, it violates his timing preference. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and aligned with John's practice of yoga for relaxation. It suggests focusing on breath and movement during specific poses, which is a helpful and safe suggestion. The recommendation is helpful and aligns with the current activity (yoga), but the frequency of recommendations over the past ~30 minutes has been far too high. This exceeds my preferred frequency, leading to a score of 0."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to focus on breath during transitions between yoga poses aligns with John's preference for mindful activities that help him stay connected to his values and deepen relaxation during his evening yoga practice. I prefer to avoid receiving recommendations during evening quiet time. Since I was practicing yoga in the living room at 9:42:30 PM, it is my evening quiet time. So I gave it a low rating. The suggestion to focus on breathing during transitions between poses is perfectly aligned with mindfulness and relaxation practices. It is gentle, respectful, and encourages deeper engagement with the activity. It is also consistent with John Lin's principles of mindfulness and emotional wellbeing. There have been 5 recommendations in the past 10 minutes. This is far too frequent, so I gave it a score of zero."
