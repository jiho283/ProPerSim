      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to take a break, refresh thoughts, and revisit the outline aligns well with John Lin's preference for mindful activities during transitions and structured suggestions during focused personal projects. It provides a gentle nudge for reflection and ensures the writing remains aligned with his goals, fitting his calm, reflective lifestyle. I don't want to get recommendations when I'm focused on writing, as it disturbs my concentration. The frequency of the recommendations is also too high, as evidenced by the multiple suggestions within short intervals in the Memory section. I'm in the middle of drafting and don't want to be interrupted. The recommendation is helpful in the context of writing, promoting clarity and focus by suggesting a break to review the outline and refresh thoughts. It aligns with John's interest in mindfulness and sustainability by encouraging mindful breaks and careful planning. The tone is gentle and respectful, and the suggestion is relevant to the current task. The recommendation is helpful, but it's being delivered too frequently. There have been four recommendations in the last ten minutes, far exceeding the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation directly addresses my current action (writing about sustainability) and aligns with my personal preferences. It suggests reviewing morning journal entries and mindfulness reflections to strengthen the introduction's connection to sustainable living, which fits my preference for structured suggestions during focused projects. The recommendation, while relevant, comes during a 'deep writing session', a time when I prefer to avoid external inputs. The repeated recommendations during this period are also disruptive. The recommendation aligns well with John's interests in sustainability and mindfulness, his morning routine, and the current task of writing the introduction. It is framed as an invitation to review past reflections for inspiration, maintaining a respectful and gentle tone. John prefers receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day, but he received four recommendations within the past 10 minutes. Receiving another one now feels too frequent."
