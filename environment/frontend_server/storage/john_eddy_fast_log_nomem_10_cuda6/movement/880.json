      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to notice the aroma of the food and how it complements the ambiance aligns well with John Lin's mindful approach to eating and his overall lifestyle. It's a gentle suggestion that encourages sensory awareness and enhances the dining experience, fitting with his preference for calm, reflective activities. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, and I avoid receiving them during focused work or evening quiet time. Now I am having lunch, so I don't want to get any recommendations. The agent's recommendation to notice the aroma of food complements the ambiance fits well with John Lin's mindful eating habits and aligns with his values of sustainability and mindfulness. The tone is gentle and non-intrusive, fostering emotional wellbeing and respecting his contemplative nature. John prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day, but the assistant has provided four recommendations within the past 10 minutes, and many more throughout the morning. This recommendation, while relevant to the activity, contributes to excessive prompting, which is undesirable."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to notice surroundings, breathe fresh air, and admire nature while walking aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for mindful activities during transitions. Cleaning the kitchen and washing dishes after lunch is a transition point, making this a relevant and thoughtful suggestion. The recommendation was given while I was cleaning up after lunch, which doesn't align with my preferred times for receiving suggestions (early morning or late afternoon). I want to be free from external input to protect my concentration. The recommendation is well-aligned with John's interests in mindfulness, sustainability, and nature. It promotes relaxation and observation, fitting his preferences for a calm and gentle approach, and it's a safe and considerate suggestion. The recommendations are coming far too frequently. While the suggestion itself is reasonable, the sheer number of prompts in the last hour is overwhelming and goes against my preferred frequency of around three times per day. It's important for the assistant to allow space for reflection and avoid constant prompting."
