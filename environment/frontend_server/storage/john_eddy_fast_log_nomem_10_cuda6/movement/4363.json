It is the fifth similar recommendation within a very short time frame (10 minutes), suggesting a lack of contextual understanding. This does not align with my preference for thoughtful suggestions. The recommendation is delivered while I'm in the middle of a deep writing session. I prefer to avoid recommendations during these times to protect my concentration. The recommendation aligns with John Lin's principles of sustainability and mindfulness and encourages a break in nature, which is consistent with his lifestyle and interests. The tone is gentle and respectful, fitting his preference for a friendly suggestion. There have already been four recommendations in the past ten minutes. Given John Lin's preference for recommendations approximately every 4 hours, this recommendation is far too frequent."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to take a short walk in the garden to refresh the mind and gather inspiration aligns perfectly with John Lin's lifestyle and preferences. It's a gentle nudge towards a mindful activity during a focused writing session, fitting his preference for calm and reflective suggestions. It also connects to his interests in sustainability and nature, making it a highly relevant and helpful suggestion. I am currently in a deep writing session, and I don't want to receive recommendations during these times. The frequency of similar recommendations is also becoming a bit much. The recommendation aligns with John's interests and values, suggesting a mindful break in the garden to gather inspiration, which fits his contemplative nature and writing focus. The tone is gentle and respectful, encouraging rather than demanding. The recommendation aligns with the task, but it's being given far too frequently. There have been four similar recommendations in the last ten minutes, significantly exceeding the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours. "
