It's a gentle suggestion that supports his well-being during his writing process. John Lin prefers receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, there have been many recommendations in the past 1.5 hours, and the agent keeps making suggestions, so it is being provided at a higher frequency than preferred."
