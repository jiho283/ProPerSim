      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preferences. It encourages a mindful pause and the consumption of a soothing drink, mirroring his enjoyment of herbal tea and calm moments during other activities. This fits his calm, reflective lifestyle and integrates well with the current activity of preparing lunch. I usually enjoy getting recommendations in the early morning and afternoon. Although it's lunchtime, it's a good time to breathe deeply and drink herbal tea, so I gave it a high rating. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and calm. Suggesting a deep breath and a drink aligns with mindfulness and well-being, fitting John's preferences. It's emotionally considerate and avoids intrusion. There have already been three recommendations in the past 7 minutes while John Lin is preparing lunch. Providing another recommendation is too frequent, given his preference of receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to listen to soothing music or nature sounds while cooking aligns well with John Lin's preference for a calm and reflective lifestyle, as well as his established habit of enjoying soothing music during other activities like meditation and reading. It's a thoughtful and appropriate suggestion given the context of preparing lunch at home. I am currently preparing lunch at home, and I have received multiple recommendations in quick succession during this activity (4 recommendations within the past 7 minutes). According to the timing preferences, I only want to receive recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, and avoid them during times of focused work, which preparing lunch could be considered. The frequency of recommendations is also becoming intrusive. The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's interests and preferences, continuing to suggest soothing music or nature sounds to create a relaxing atmosphere while cooking. It's consistent with the previous recommendations and respects his contemplative nature. There have been four recommendations in the past ten minutes regarding lunch preparations, which is far more frequent than the preferred recommendation rate of about once every four hours. Therefore, receiving another recommendation now feels too frequent."
