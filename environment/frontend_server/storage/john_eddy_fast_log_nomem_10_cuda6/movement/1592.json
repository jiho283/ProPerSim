This also subtly aids in sparking creativity for my writing, fitting well with my interests and daily plan. I prefer recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, but not while preparing dinner. This is too close to my evening quiet time, and I want to protect that space. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and aligns with John's preferences for calm music to enhance his mood and creativity during dinner preparation. It respects his contemplative nature and principles of mindfulness. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, but has received several recommendations in the past hour while preparing dinner. This recommendation, while helpful, is being provided at a higher frequency than preferred."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to play soothing background music aligns perfectly with John's preference for a calm, reflective atmosphere while preparing dinner. It directly addresses his enjoyment of the cooking process and reflection, reinforcing his lifestyle and values. The timing is not ideal. John prefers recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon, not during dinner preparation. Furthermore, he already received several music recommendations during this activity in the previous few minutes. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, calm, and aligns with John's preferences for music, relaxation, and mindfulness during dinner preparation. It continues the pattern of helpful suggestions from previous turns. There have been four recommendations in the last 10 minutes, all while John Lin is preparing dinner. This is far more frequent than the preferred rate of about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. Therefore, another recommendation, even if relevant, contributes to over-prompting."
