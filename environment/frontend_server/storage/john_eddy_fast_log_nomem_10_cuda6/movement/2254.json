      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to jot down notes or sketch out ideas related to future plans aligns well with John Lin's preference for reflective activities during his evening walk. It encourages him to solidify his intentions under the night sky, fitting his calm and reflective lifestyle. I prefer to avoid receiving recommendations during evening quiet time, as I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation was given at 9:52:30 PM, which falls under evening quiet time. Therefore, I gave it a low rating. The suggestion to jot down notes or sketch out ideas aligns well with John's current activity of reflecting and planning during his evening walk. It's a gentle and respectful suggestion that fits his contemplative nature and supports his focus on sustainability, mindfulness, and emotional well-being. It is consistent with previous recommendations.  The recommendation is helpful and relevant to my current activity of taking an evening walk and contemplating future plans. However, considering the high frequency of recommendations in the last hour, including those at 09:42:30 PM, 09:45:00 PM, 09:47:30 PM, and 09:50:00 PM, this additional suggestion contributes to an excessively high recommendation frequency, exceeding my preferred rate of about once every 4 hours."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns with John Lin's preference for reflective activities during his evening walk, suggesting a structured yet mindful way to plan for the future by setting weekly goals related to sustainability and mindfulness, fitting his values and lifestyle. The recommendation arrived during my evening quiet time, a period I prefer to keep free from external inputs. The timing conflicts with my desire to protect my concentration and sense of calm during this part of the day. The recommendation is well-aligned with John Lin's personality, interests, and current activity. It suggests a way to further integrate his values (sustainability and mindfulness) into his future plans, and the suggestion to stop at a quiet spot to write is consistent with his contemplative nature. The tone is gentle and respectful, fitting the Communication & Safety guidelines. There have been four recommendations in the past 7 minutes. This is much more frequent than the preferred recommendation frequency."
