It also suggests a practical way to enhance the flavor and freshness of his dishes, complementing his cooking process. I prefer recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon, not during dinner preparation. This is too frequent, as I received several similar recommendations in the last few minutes. The agent continues to recommend adding basil or parsley, which feels repetitive and lacks novelty. While the tone is appropriate and the suggestion aligns with my interests, the lack of variety makes it less helpful. This repetition could be avoided with better memory or a slightly different approach. I prefer to receive recommendations about once every 4 hours, and there have already been four recommendations in the past ten minutes. The current recommendation is too frequent."

      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to add fresh herbs like basil or parsley to the dish aligns perfectly with John Lin's lifestyle, interests, and the ongoing activity of preparing dinner. It is consistent with previous successful recommendations and promotes mindfulness and sustainable living. The recommendation is relevant to my current activity (preparing dinner), and I appreciate the focus on fresh, natural ingredients from my garden. However, I am not particularly eager to receive assistant recommendations during dinner preparation, as stated in the [Timing] section. The agent has already made the same recommendation several times within the last few minutes. This feels repetitive and slightly intrusive, not aligned with my preference for a gentle and respectful tone. The assistant has been providing similar recommendations about adding herbs to the dish repeatedly in the last few minutes. This is far more frequent than the preferred frequency of about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. Therefore, even though the suggestion itself is reasonable, the high frequency warrants a score of 0."
