      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to play soft instrumental music while cooking aligns well with John Lin's preference for a calm and reflective atmosphere, especially considering his focus on mindfulness and sustainability. It also resonates with previous suggestions related to music and mindful cooking, indicating consistency in understanding his preferences. I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning, shortly after journaling, and again in the late afternoon when winding down. The current recommendation is given during dinner preparation in the evening, which I avoid because I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm. The recommendation aligns well with John's preferences for a calm atmosphere, mindful cooking, and inspiration for his writing on sustainability. It's gentle, respectful, and consistent with his values, making it a suitable suggestion. There have already been four recommendations in the last ten minutes while I'm preparing dinner. This is far more frequent than my preferred frequency, which is about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. Therefore, this recommendation is not helpful and contributes to the problem of excessive prompting."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation to play soft jazz or acoustic guitar music while cooking aligns perfectly with John Lin's preference for a calm ambiance and mindful activities. It supports his focus on sustainability and mindfulness while preparing dinner, fitting well with his lifestyle and preferences. The recommendation occurs during dinner preparation, which doesn't align with John's preferred times for receiving recommendations (early morning or late afternoon). He also prefers to avoid recommendations during focused activities like cooking in the evening. The recommendation aligns with John's principles of sustainability and mindfulness, encourages a calming atmosphere, and uses a gentle, respectful tone, fitting his preferences. It builds upon previous suggestions and continues to support his daily plan and interests. John Lin prefers recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. However, he has already received numerous recommendations in the past few hours. This recommendation, while relevant, contributes to an unacceptably high frequency. Therefore, the recommendation receives a score of 0."
