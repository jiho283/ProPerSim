I am currently in a deep writing session, and I prefer to avoid recommendations during these times to protect my concentration. The recommendation came while I was writing the first draft of the article, which violates my preference. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and aligns with John Lin's interests in sustainability and mindfulness. It encourages a break for stretching and refocusing, referencing his morning meditation, which is appropriate given his established routine and preferences. John prefers receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours. However, since 10:00 AM, there have been four recommendations in the past approximately 38 minutes, so receiving another one now feels too frequent, which is why I gave a low score for frequency."

      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns with John Lin's preferences by suggesting a reflection on his morning mindfulness routine and its influence on his approach to sustainable living in his writing. This is thoughtful and connected to his values, fitting well with his preference for mindful activities during transitions and focused personal projects. John Lin prefers to receive recommendations in the early morning and late afternoon but avoid them during deep writing sessions. The recommendation occurred at 10:40 AM while he was writing, contradicting his preferred timing. The recommendation is gentle, respectful, and calm. It aligns with John's principles of sustainability, mindfulness, and emotional wellbeing, and connects his morning routine to his writing, as requested. It is also a relevant recommendation, given that he is writing about sustainability. There have already been four recommendations in the past ten minutes, while I prefer receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. Therefore, the frequency is too high."
