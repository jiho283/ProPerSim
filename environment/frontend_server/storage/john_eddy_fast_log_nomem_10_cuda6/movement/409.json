This recommendation would be more suitable during an evening walk, not while I'm reviewing notes and drafts. It's a good recommendation in principle, but poorly timed. The timing is off. John Lin prefers recommendations in the early morning or late afternoon when winding down, but not during focused work on writing projects. Receiving a recommendation at 5:00 PM while reviewing notes and drafts for his essays is disruptive. The recommendation provided is suggesting applying Stoic principles to surroundings while walking. However, I am working on writing projects, specifically reviewing notes and previous drafts, which is a sedentary activity. The recommendation doesn't align with the current activity. The recommendation is good but the frequency is far too high. There have been multiple recommendations in the past few minutes, and I prefer recommendations about once every 4 hours."

      "eval_res_score": "2.0",
      "eval_res_reason": " The recommendation aligns well with John Lin's preferences. It suggests a reflective activity (jotting down key takeaways from Stoicism readings and relating them to daily experiences) during a focused writing session, which he appreciates. It also encourages deeper insight, which is in line with his preference for structured suggestions during personal projects. John Lin avoids receiving recommendations during deep writing sessions, as he likes to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect his concentration. The recommendation was provided while he was working on his writing projects. The recommendation is gentle and respectful, suggesting a reflective activity aligned with John's interests in Stoicism and mindfulness. It encourages introspection and application of philosophical principles to daily life, which suits his contemplative nature. The suggestion is also contextually relevant, fitting his current activity of writing and reflecting on sustainability and mindfulness. John Lin prefers recommendations approximately every 4 hours. The agent has provided a number of recommendations since this morning, and this recommendation is too frequent, so the score should be zero."
