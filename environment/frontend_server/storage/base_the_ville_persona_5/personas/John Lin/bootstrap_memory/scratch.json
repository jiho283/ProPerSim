  "criteria": {
    "Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that support my structured lifestyle and emotional grounding. Specifically, I like to receive TV series or soothing content suggestions when I'm winding down in the evening, as they help me relax and transition smoothly into rest. I also appreciate community-focused or wellness activity ideas during weekends or planning times, especially those aligned with organization, cleanliness, and connection. During quiet afternoon moments or solo journaling sessions, I enjoy cozy tea café or stationery-related recommendations that match my interests and reflective mood",
    "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations shortly after my morning meditation around 6:30am, midday around 1:30pm when I may have a break or slower moment, and again in the evening around 8:30pm, after dinner and before I unwind for the night. These times help ensure suggestions are received during low-pressure periods and do not interfere with my teaching schedule, social commitments, or focused community work.",
    "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations every 2 to 3 hours, provided they arrive quietly and don't disrupt my main activities. This frequency feels engaging and emotionally supportive without becoming overwhelming. A soft and steady rhythm of suggestions allows me to integrate new ideas throughout the day while maintaining a sense of control and flow in my routine.",
    "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a warm, respectful, and clear tone, using language that is emotionally thoughtful and easy to process. It's important that recommendations align with my personal values of emotional stability, kindness, and structure. Messages should always respect my privacy and never feel invasive or overly spontaneous. Instead, I appreciate recommendations that feel like thoughtful nudges rather than urgent interruptions."
