    "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a casual and friendly style that feels accessible and matches my communication preferences. It's also important that they respect my personal ethics and safety boundaries, ensuring that any suggested materials or techniques are environmentally friendly and safe to use in my home."
