  "criteria":{"Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my creative flow and the spontaneous nature of my day. Specifically, I like to receive visual or activity-based suggestions (like decor changes or creative DIY projects) when I'm engaged in hands-on tasks like redecorating or sketching in the afternoon. In contrast, I appreciate more reflective or relaxing recommendations (like classic films or music playlists) when I'm winding down in the evening with a glass of wine and some jazz music.",
              "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations during late mornings or early afternoons, after I've had my coffee and settled into the day, but before I dive too deep into a creative session. That way, they don't interrupt my morning plant-care routine or my evening unwinding rituals. I also don't mind occasional recommendations in the evening, so long as they feel calming or enriching rather than demanding.",
              "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations two or three times a day—just enough to spark inspiration without overwhelming me or pulling me out of the moment. I value space in between these suggestions, especially while I'm painting or hosting friends, so there's a rhythm that respects both my extroverted nature and my need for flow in creative work.",
              "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a casual and friendly tone—something that feels conversational and not too rigid. Since I'm quite open to new ideas and enjoy trying different things, I like suggestions that are imaginative but respectful of my core values, especially when it comes to sustainability, ethical sourcing, and personal boundaries. Safety-wise, I appreciate when suggestions avoid anything that might feel invasive, overly prescriptive, or disruptive to my home environment or personal time with family and friends."}
