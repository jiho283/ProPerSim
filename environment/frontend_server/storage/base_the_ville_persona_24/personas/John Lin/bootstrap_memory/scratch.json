  "criteria": {
    "Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my approach to handling activities and suit my current context. Specifically, I like to receive creative design inspiration when I'm sketching or designing in the afternoon, and new coffee brewing methods when I'm experimenting with my morning espresso routine. I also appreciate recommendations for unique board games or documentaries when I'm planning a game night or a late-night viewing session.",
    "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations in the morning, around 10am, while preparing my espresso and time to start my creative work. This timing ensures they give fresh motivations on my morning routine or my focused design sessions in the afternoon. I also appreciate receiving recommendations in the evening, around 8pm, when I'm winding down and planning my leisure activities for the night.",
    "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations three times a day: once in the late morning, once in the afternoon, and once in the evening. This frequency allows me to stay inspired and informed without feeling overwhelmed. It provides a good balance between recommendation intervals and quiet periods, supporting my focus and productivity during my creative work.",
    "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a casual and friendly style that feels accessible and matches my communication preferences. It's important that they respect my personal ethics and safety boundaries, ensuring that the content is appropriate and aligns with my values."
