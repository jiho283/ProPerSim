    "Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that align with my approach to handling activities and suit my current context. Specifically, I like to receive entertainment recommendations, such as new reality TV shows or YouTube channels, when I'm taking a break from work or feeling stressed.

There should be a good balance between recommendation intervals and quiet periods, allowing me to process and act on the suggestions without feeling overwhelmed.",
    "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a casual and friendly style that feels accessible and matches my communication preferences. It's also important that they respect my personal ethics and safety boundaries, ensuring that the suggestions are practical and considerate of my current lifestyle and goals."
