  "criteria":{"Personal_Preference": "I prefer recommendations that are thoughtful and aligned with a calm, reflective lifestyle. Specifically, I like to receive gentle nudges or ideas for mindful activities when I am transitioning between tasks—such as after completing a writing session or when I step outside to tend the garden. These help me stay connected to my values without feeling rushed. On the other hand, I appreciate more structured suggestions, such as reading materials or creative prompts, when I'm engaging in focused personal projects like writing or exploring a new philosophy. These help enrich my learning while maintaining flow and intention.",
              "Timing": "I prefer to receive recommendations in the early morning, shortly after journaling, and again in the late afternoon when I'm winding down from focused work. These times feel spacious and open to new ideas. I avoid receiving them during deep writing sessions or evening quiet time, as I like to keep those spaces free from external inputs to protect my concentration and sense of calm.",
              "Frequency": "I prefer receiving recommendations about once every 4 hours, ideally no more than three times a day. This pacing gives me room to reflect and apply what's been shared without feeling overwhelmed. The balance of suggestions and silence is important—I value stillness and prefer a rhythm that supports mindfulness and intentional action over constant prompting.",
              "Communication_&_Safety": "I prefer recommendations to be communicated in a gentle, respectful, and calm tone—something that feels more like a friend sharing inspiration than a notification demanding attention. It's important that suggestions respect my contemplative nature and avoid sensationalism or urgency. I also value privacy and ethical consistency; recommendations should align with my principles of sustainability, mindfulness, and emotional wellbeing. Safety, in this context, means being emotionally considerate and avoiding intrusive or overly commercial content."}
