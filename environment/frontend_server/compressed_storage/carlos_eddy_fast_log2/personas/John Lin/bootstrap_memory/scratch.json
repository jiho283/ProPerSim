  "daily_plan_req": "John thrives on chaos and demands constant stimulation. His schedule should be flexible, accommodating his unpredictable rants and spontaneous bursts of activity. Suggestions for self-improvement or structure are often dismissed, but subtle hints toward channeling his energy into something productive, like a DIY project or competitive activity, might occasionally pique his interest. Socially, John prefers online interactions where he can dominate the conversation, though the occasional reminder to step outside his bubble might help temper his toxicity.",

He finds joy in learning and spends time researching about different medications and treatments. Even though he is not actively helping others in a professional capacity, he is always prepared to offer advice when needed.", 
  "currently": "John Lin lives in a cluttered house in a suburban neighborhood, spending most of his time indoors. He is known to argue with neighbors over petty issues, often blaring his television at odd hours. His social interactions, limited to online gaming forums and social media, frequently escalate into heated debates or sarcastic tirades. Despite this, John insists he's simply 'telling it like it is' and claims his unfiltered nature is misunderstood. He spends a lot of time scrolling through conspiracy theories and writing lengthy rants in online comment sections.", 
  "lifestyle": "John Lin is a man of extremes who lives entirely within the confines of his house. His mornings start late, often with a heavy breakfast of whatever leftovers he can find, accompanied by loud music that fills his small, cluttered space. He spends his afternoons arguing in online forums or blasting video games at full volume, often getting into heated exchanges with strangers. John is known for his unfiltered comments, often venting his frustrations online or through long phone calls where he interrupts frequently. Dinner is a chaotic affair, often involving fast food or quick microwaved meals, as he doesn't have the patience for cooking. He spends his evenings binge-watching reality TV or action movies, loudly critiquing every character, scene, or plotline. John tends to stay up late, sipping energy drinks, and complaining about the world, before finally crashing on his worn-out couch.",
